<h2>PREFACE.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> deference to the expressed wishes of
some of his young friends, the author has
essayed a story of the sea, and now presents
"Charlie Codman's Cruise," as the third volume
of the Campaign Series. It will be
found more adventurous than its predecessors,
and the trials which Charlie is called
upon to encounter are of a severer character
than befell Frank Frost or Paul Prescott.
But it will be found that they were met with
the same manly spirit, and a like determination
to be faithful to duty at all hazards.</p>

<p>Though not wholly a stranger to the sea,
the author is quite aware of the blunders to
which a landsman is exposed in treating of
matters and a mode of life which, at the best,
he must comprehend but imperfectly, and
has endeavored to avoid, as far as possible,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
professional technicalities, as not essential to
the interest of the story.</p>

<p>With these few words he submits the
present volume to his young readers, hoping
for it a welcome even more generous than
has been accorded to "Frank's Campaign"
and "Paul Prescott's Charge."</p>

<h2>I.<br /> <small>CHARLIE AND THE MISER.</small></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlie Codman</span> turned out of Washington
into Bedford Street just as the clock in
the Old South steeple struck two. He was
about fourteen, a handsome, well-made boy,
with a bright eye and a manly expression.
But he was poor. That was evident enough
from his clothes, which, though neat and free
from dust, were patched in several places.
He had a small roll of daily papers under his
arm, the remains of his stock in trade, which
he had been unable wholly to dispose of.</p>

<p>Some of my readers may know that the
Latin School and English High School are
kept in the same building. At two o'clock<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
both are dismissed. Charlie had scarcely
passed the school-house when a crowd of
boys issued from the school-yard, and he
heard his name called from behind. Looking
back he recognized a boy somewhat
smaller than himself, with whom he had
formed an acquaintance some time before.</p>

<p>"Where are you bound, Charlie?" asked
Edwin Banks.</p>

<p>"I'm going home now."</p>

<p>"What luck have you had this morning?"</p>

<p>"Not much. I've got four papers left
over, and that will take away about all my
profits."</p>

<p>"What a pity you are poor, Charlie. I
wish you could come to school with us."</p>

<p>"So do I, Eddie. I'd give a good deal to
get an education, but I feel that I ought to
help mother."</p>

<p>"Why won't you come some time, and see
us, Charlie? Clare and myself would be
very glad to see you at any time."</p>

<p>"I should like to go," said Charlie, "but I
don't look fit."</p>

<p>"Oh, never mind about your clothes. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
like you just as well as if you were dressed
in style."</p>

<p>"Perhaps I'll come some time," said Charlie.
"I'd invite you to come and see me, but we
live in a poor place."</p>

<p>"Just as if I should care for that. I will
come whenever I get an invitation."</p>

<p>"Then come next Saturday afternoon. I
will be waiting for you as you come out of
school."</p>

<p>Charlie little thought where he would be
when Saturday came.</p>

<p>Shortly after the boys separated, and
Charlie's attention was arrested by the sight
of an old man with a shambling gait, who
was bending over and anxiously searching
for something on the sidewalk. Charlie recognized
him at once as "old Manson, the
miser," for this was the name by which he
generally went.</p>

<p>Old Peter Manson was not more than fifty-five,
but he looked from fifteen to twenty
years older. If his body had been properly
cared for, it would have been different; but,
one by one, its functions had been blunted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
and destroyed, and it had become old and out
of repair. Peter's face was ploughed with
wrinkles. His cheeks were thin, and the skin
was yellow and hung in folds. His beard
appeared to have received little or no attention
for a week, at least, and was now stiff
and bristling.</p>

<p>The miser's dress was not very well fitted
to his form. It was in the fashion of twenty
years before. Grayish pantaloons, patched
in divers places with dark cloth by an unskilful
hand; a vest from which the buttons had
long since departed, and which was looped
together by pieces of string, but not closely
enough to conceal a dirty and tattered shirt
beneath; a coat in the last stages of shabbiness;
while over all hung a faded blue cloak,
which Peter wore in all weathers. In the
sultriest days of August he might have been
seen trudging along in this old mantle, which
did him the good service of hiding a multitude
of holes and patches, while in January
he went no warmer clad. There were some
who wondered how he could stand the bitter
cold of winter with no more adequate covering;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
but if Peter's body was as tough as his
conscience, there was no fear of his suffering.</p>

<p>Charlie paused a moment to see what it
was that the old man was hunting for.</p>

<p>"Have you lost anything?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Peter, in quavering accents.
"See if you can't find it, that's a good boy.
Your eyes are better than mine."</p>

<p>"What is it?"</p>

<p>"It is some money, and I&mdash;I'm so poor, I
can't afford to lose it."</p>

<p>"How much was it?"</p>

<p>"It wasn't much, but I'm so poor I need
it."</p>

<p>Charlie espied a cent, lying partially concealed
by mud, just beside the curb-stone.
He picked it up.</p>

<p>"This isn't what you lost, is it?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Peter, seizing it eagerly.
"You're a good boy to find it. A good
boy!"</p>

<p>"Well," thought Charlie, wondering, as
the old man hobbled off with his recovered
treasure, "I'd rather be poor than care so
much for money as that. People say old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
Peter's worth his thousands. I wonder
whether it is so."</p>

<p>Charlie little dreamed how much old Peter
was likely to influence his destiny, and how,
at his instigation, before a week had passed
over his head, he would find himself in a
very disagreeable situation.</p>

<p>We must follow Peter.</p>

<p>With his eyes fixed on the ground he shuffled
along, making more rapid progress than
could have been expected. Occasionally he
would stoop down and pick up any little
stray object which arrested his attention,
even to a crooked pin, which he thrust into
his cloak, muttering as he did so, "Save my
buying any. I haven't had to buy any pins
for more'n ten years, and I don't mean to
buy any more while I live. Ha! ha! Folks
are <i>so</i> extravagant! They buy things they
don't need, or that they might pick up, if
they'd only take the trouble to keep their
eyes open. 'Tisn't so with old Peter. He's
too cunning for that. There goes a young
fellow dressed up in the fashion. What he's
got on must have cost nigh on to a hundred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
dollars. What dreadful extravagance! Ha!
ha! It hasn't cost old Peter twenty dollars
for the last ten years. If he had spent money
as some do, he might have been in the poor-house
by this time. Ugh! ugh! it costs a
dreadful sum to live. If we could only come
into the world with natural clothes, like cats,
what a deal better it would be. But it costs
the most for food. Oh dear! what a dreadful
appetite I've got, and I <i>must</i> eat. All the
money spent for victuals seem thrown away.
I've a good mind, sometimes, to go to the
poor-house, where it wouldn't cost me anything.
What a blessing it would be to eat,
if you could only get food for nothing!"</p>

<p>It is very clear that Peter would have been
far better off, as far as the comforts of life are
concerned, in the city almshouse; but there
were some little obstacles in the way of his
entering. For instance, it would scarcely
have been allowed a public pensioner to go
round quarterly to collect his rents,&mdash;a thing
which Peter would hardly have relinquished.</p>

<p>Reflections upon the cost of living brought
to Peter's recollection that he had nothing at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
home for supper. He accordingly stepped
into a baker's shop close at hand.</p>

<p>"Have you got any bread cheap?" he inquired
of the baker.</p>

<p>"We intend to sell at moderate prices."</p>

<p>"What do you ask for those loaves?" said
the old man, looking wistfully at some fresh
loaves piled upon the counter, which had been
but a short time out of the oven.</p>

<p>"Five cents apiece," said the baker. "I'll
warrant you will find them good. They are
made of the best of flour."</p>

<p>"Isn't five cents rather dear?" queried
Peter, his natural appetite struggling with his
avarice.</p>

<p>"Dear!" retorted the baker, opening his
eyes in astonishment; "why, my good sir, at
what price do you expect to buy bread?"</p>

<p>"I've no doubt they're very good," said
Peter, hastily; "but have you any stale
loaves? I guess they'll be better for
me."</p>

<p>"Yes," said the baker, "I believe I have,
but they're not as good as the fresh bread."</p>

<p>"How do you sell your stale loaves?" inquired<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
Peter, fumbling in his pocket for some
change.</p>

<p>"I sell them for about half price&mdash;three
cents apiece."</p>

<p>"You may give me one, then; I guess it'll
be better for me."</p>

<p>Even Peter was a little ashamed to acknowledge
that it was the price alone which
influenced his choice.</p>

<p>The baker observed that, notwithstanding
his decision, he continued to look wistfully
towards the fresh bread. Never having seen
old Peter before, he was unacquainted with
his character, and judging from his dilapidated
appearance that he might be prevented,
by actual poverty, from buying the fresh
bread, exclaimed with a sudden impulse:
"You seem to be poor. If you only want
one loaf, I will for this once give you a fresh
loaf for three cents&mdash;the same price I ask for
the stale bread."</p>

<p>"Will you?"</p>

<p>Old Peter's eyes sparkled with eagerness as
he said this.</p>

<p>"Poor man!" thought the baker with mistaken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
compassion; "he must indeed be needy,
to be so pleased."</p>

<p>"Yes," he continued, "you shall have a
loaf this once for three cents. Shall I put it
in a paper for you?"</p>

<p>Peter nodded.</p>

<p>Meanwhile he was busy fumbling in his
pockets for the coins requisite to purchase
the loaf. He drew out three battered cents,
and deposited them with reluctant hand on
the counter. He gazed at them wistfully while
the baker carelessly swept them with his hand
into the till behind the counter; and then
with a sigh of resignation, at parting with the
coins, seized the loaf and shambled out into
the street.</p>

<p>He put the bundle under his arm, and hastened
up the street, his mouth watering in
anticipation of the feast which awaited him.
Do not laugh, reader,&mdash;little as you may
regard a fresh loaf of bread, it was indeed a
treat to Peter, who was accustomed, from motives
of economy, to regale himself upon stale
bread.</p>

<p>The baker was congratulating himself upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
having done a charitable action, when Peter
came back in haste, pale with affright.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I&mdash;," he stammered, "must have
dropped some money. You haven't picked
up any, have you?"</p>

<p>"Not I!" said the baker, carelessly. "If you
dropped it here you will find it somewhere
on the floor. Stay, I will assist you."</p>

<p>Peter seemed rather disconcerted than
otherwise by this offer of assistance, but could
not reasonably interpose any objection.</p>

<p>After a very brief search Peter and the
baker simultaneously discovered the missing
coin. The former pounced upon it, but not before
the latter had recognized it as a gold piece.</p>

<p>"Ho, ho!" thought he, in surprise, "my
charity is not so well bestowed as I thought.
Do you have many such coins?" he asked,
meaningly.</p>

<p>"I?" said Peter, hastily, "Oh no! I am very
poor. This is all I have, and I expect it will
be gone soon,&mdash;it costs so much to live!"</p>

<p>"It'll never cost you much," thought the
baker, watching the shabby figure of the
miser as he receded from the shop.</p>

<h2>II.<br /> <small>A MISER'S HOUSEHOLD.</small></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Peter Manson</span> owned a small house in an
obscure street. It was a weather-beaten
tenement of wood, containing some six or
eight rooms, all of which, with one exception,
were given over to dirt, cobwebs, gloom, and
desolation. Peter might readily have let the
rooms which he did not require for his own
use, but so profound was his distrust of
human nature, that not even the prospect of
receiving rent for the empty rooms could
overcome his apprehension of being robbed
by neighbors under the same roof. For
Peter trusted not his money to banks or railroads,
but wanted to have it directly under
his own eye or within his reach. As for
investing his gold in the luxuries of life, or
even in what were generally considered its
absolute necessaries, we have already seen
that Peter was no such fool as that. A gold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
eagle was worth ten times more to him than
its equivalent in food or clothing.</p>

<p>With more than his usual alacrity, old
Peter Manson, bearing under his cloak the
fresh loaf which he had just procured from
the baker on such advantageous terms,
hastened to his not very inviting home.</p>

<p>Drawing from his pocket a large and rusty
door-key, he applied it to the door. It turned
in the lock with a creaking sound, and the
door yielding to Peter's push he entered.</p>

<p>The room which he appropriated to his
own use was in the second story. It was a
large room, of some eighteen feet square, and,
as it is hardly necessary to say, was not set off
by expensive furniture. The articles which
came under this denomination were briefly
these,&mdash;a cherry table which was minus one
leg, whose place had been supplied by a
broom handle fitted in its place; three hard
wooden chairs of unknown antiquity; an old
wash-stand; a rusty stove which Peter had
picked up cheap at an auction, after finding
that a stove burned out less fuel than a fireplace;
a few articles of crockery of different<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
patterns, some cracked and broken; a few
tin dishes, such as Peter found essential in
his cooking; and a low truckle bedstead with
a scanty supply of bedclothes.</p>

<p>Into this desolate home Peter entered.</p>

<p>There was an ember or two left in the
stove, which the old man contrived, by hard
blowing, to kindle into life. On these he
placed a few sticks, part of which he had
picked up in the street early in the morning,
and soon there was a little show of fire, over
which the miser spread his hands greedily as
if to monopolize what little heat might proceed
therefrom. He looked wistfully at the
pile of wood remaining, but prudence withheld
him from putting on any more.</p>

<p>"Everything costs money," he muttered to
himself. "Three times a day I have to eat,
and that costs a sight. Why couldn't we get
along with eating once a day? That would
save two thirds. Then there's fire. That
costs money, too. Why isn't it always summer?
Then we shouldn't need any except to
cook by. It seems a sin to throw away good,
bright, precious gold on what is going to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
burnt up and float away in smoke. One
might almost as well throw it into the river
at once. Ugh! only to think of what it
would cost if I couldn't pick up some sticks
in the street. There was a little girl picking
up some this morning when I was out. If it
hadn't been for her, I should have got more.
What business had she to come there, I should
like to know?"</p>

<p>"Ugh, ugh!"</p>

<p>The blaze was dying out, and Peter was
obliged, against his will, to put on a fresh
supply of fuel.</p>

<p>By this time the miser's appetite began to
assert itself, and rising from his crouching
position over the fire he walked to the table
on which he had deposited his loaf of bread.
With an old jack-knife he carefully cut the
loaf into two equal parts. One of these he
put back into the closet. From the same
place he also brought out a sausage, and
placing it over the fire contrived to cook it
after a fashion. Taking it off he placed it on
a plate, and seated himself on a chair by the
table.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>It was long since the old man, accustomed
to stale bread,&mdash;because he found it cheaper,&mdash;had
tasted anything so delicious. No
alderman ever smacked his lips over the most
exquisite turtle soup with greater relish than
Peter Manson over his banquet.</p>

<p>"It is very good," he muttered, with a sigh
of satisfaction. "I don't fare so well every
day. If it hadn't been for that unlucky piece
of gold, perhaps the baker would have let me
had another loaf at the same price."</p>

<p>He soon despatched the half loaf which he
allotted to his evening meal.</p>

<p>"I think I could eat the other half," he
said, with unsatisfied hunger; "but I must
save that for breakfast. It is hurtful to eat
too much. Besides, here is my sausage."</p>

<p>The sausage was rather burned than cooked,
but Peter was neither nice nor fastidious.
He did not eat the whole of the sausage,
however, but reserved one half of this, too,
for breakfast, though it proved so acceptable
to his palate that he came near yielding to
the temptation of eating the whole. But
prudence, or rather avarice, prevailed, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
shaking his head with renewed determination,
he carried it to the closet and placed it on
the shelf.</p>

<p>Between seven and eight o'clock Peter
prepared to go to bed, partly because this
would enable him to dispense with a fire, the
cost of which he considered so ruinous. He
had but just commenced his preparations for
bed when a loud knock was heard at the
street door.</p>

<p>At the first sound of the knocking Peter
Manson started in affright. Such a thing
had not occurred in his experience for
years.</p>

<p>"It's some drunken fellow," thought Peter.
"He's mistaken the house. I'll blow out the
candle, and then he'll think there's nobody
here."</p>

<p>He listened again, in hopes to hear the
receding steps of the visitor, but in vain.
After a brief interval there came another
knock, louder and more imperative than the
first.</p>

<p>Peter began to feel a little uneasy.</p>

<p>"Why don't he go?" he muttered, peevishly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
"He can't have anything to do with
me. Nobody ever comes here. He's mistaken
the house."</p>

<p>His reflections were here interrupted by a
volley of knocks, each apparently louder than
the last.</p>

<p>"Oh dear, what shall I do?" exclaimed
the miser with a ludicrous mixture of terror
and perplexity. "It's some desperate ruffian,
I know it is. I wish the police would come.
I shall be robbed and murdered."</p>

<p>Peter went to the window and put his
head out, hoping to discover something of his
troublesome visitor. The noise of opening
the window attracted his attention.</p>

<p>"Hilloa!" he shouted. "I thought I'd
make you hear some time or other. I began
to think you were as deaf as a post, or else
had kicked the bucket."</p>

<p>"Who's there?" asked Peter, in a quavering
voice.</p>

<p>"Who's there! Come down and see, and
don't leave a fellow to hammer away all night
at your old rat-trap. Come down, and open
the door."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>"This ain't the house," said Peter. "You've
made a mistake. Nobody ever comes here."</p>

<p>"No more I should think they would, if
you always keep 'em waiting as long as you
have me. Come along down, and let me in."</p>

<p>"But I tell you," persisted Peter, who
didn't at all like the visitor's manners, "that
you've made a mistake. This ain't the
house."</p>

<p>"Ain't what house, I'd like to know?"</p>

<p>"It ain't the house you think it is," said
the old man, a little puzzled by this question.</p>

<p>"And what house do I think it is? Tell
me that, you old&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Probably the sentence would have been
finished in a manner uncomplimentary to
Peter, but perhaps, from motives of policy,
the stranger suppressed what he had intended
to say.</p>

<p>"I don't know," returned Peter, at a loss
for a reply, "but there's a mistake somewhere.
Nobody comes to see me."</p>

<p>"I shouldn't think they would," muttered
the outsider, "but every rule has its exceptions,
and somebody's come to see you now."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>"You've mistaken the person."</p>

<p>"No, I haven't. Little chance of making
a mistake. You're old Peter Manson."</p>

<p>"He <i>has</i> come to see me," thought Peter,
uneasily; "but it cannot be for any good end.
I won't let him in; no, I won't let him in."</p>

<p>"Well what are you going to do about
it?" asked his would-be visitor, impatiently.</p>

<p>"It's too late to see you to-night."</p>

<p>"Fiddlestick!" retorted the other. "It
isn't eight yet."</p>

<p>"I'm just going to bed," added Peter, becoming
momentarily more uneasy at the man's
obstinacy.</p>

<p>"Going to bed at half past seven! Come,
now, that's all a joke. You don't take me
for a fool!"</p>

<p>"But I am," urged Peter, "I always do.
I'm very poor, and can't afford to keep a fire
and light going all the evening."</p>

<p>"You poor! Well, may be you are. But
that ain't neither here nor there. I have got
some important business to see you about,
and you must let me in."</p>

<p>"Come to-morrow."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>"It's no use; I must see you to-night. So
just come down and let me in, or it'll be the
worse for you."</p>

<p>"What a dreadful ruffian!" groaned Peter;
"I wish the watch would come along, but it
never does when it's wanted. Go away, good
man," he said, in a wheedling tone. "Go
away, and come again to-morrow."</p>

<p>"I tell you I won't go away. I must see
you to-night."</p>

<p>Convinced that the man was not to be
denied, Peter, groaning with fear, went down,
and reluctantly drawing the bolt, admitted
the visitor.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>III.<br /> <small>THE UNWELCOME VISITOR.</small></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Opening</span> the door with trembling hand
Peter Manson saw before him a stout man of
forty-five, with a complexion bronzed by exposure
to the elements.</p>

<p>Short and thick-set, with a half-defiant
expression, as if, to use a common phrase, he
"feared neither man nor devil," a glance at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
him served hardly to reassure the apprehensive
old man.</p>

<p>The stranger was attired in a suit of coarse
clothing, and appeared to possess little education
or refinement. He might be a sailor,&mdash;there
was an indefinable something about
him,&mdash;a certain air of the sea, that justified
the suspicion that he had passed some part
of his life, at least, in the realms of Father
Neptune.</p>

<p>Peter Manson, holding in his hand the
fragment of candle which flickered wildly
from the sudden gust of wind which rushed
in at the door just opened, stood in silent
apprehension, gazing uneasily at his unwelcome
visitor.</p>

<p>"Well, shipmate," said the latter, impatiently,
"how long are you going to stand
staring at me? It makes me feel bashful,
not to speak of its not being over and above
civil."</p>

<p>"What do you want?" inquired Peter, his
alarm a little increased by this speech, making,
at the same time, a motion as if to close the
door.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>"First and foremost, I should like to be
invited in somewhere, where it isn't quite so
public as at the street door. My business is
of a private nature."</p>

<p>"I don't know you," said the miser, uneasily.</p>

<p>"Well, what's the odds if I know you?"
was the careless reply. "Come, push ahead.
Where do you live? Up stairs, or down
stairs? I want to have a little private talk
with you somewhere."</p>

<p>The speaker was about to cross the threshold
when Peter stepped in front, as if to intercept
him, and said, hurriedly, "Don't come in to-night;
to-morrow will do just as well."</p>

<p>"By your leave," said the visitor, coolly,
pushing his way in, in spite of the old man's
feeble opposition. "I have already told you
that I wanted to see you to-night. Didn't
you hear me?"</p>

<p>"Thieves!" the old man half ejaculated,
but was checked by the other somewhat
sternly.</p>

<p>"No, old man, I am not a thief; but if you
don't have done with your stupid charges, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
may be tempted to verify your good opinion
by trying my hand at a little robbery. Now
lead the way to your den, wherever it is, if
you know what is best for yourself."</p>

<p>The outer door was already closed, and
Peter felt that he was at the intruder's mercy.
Nevertheless, there was something in this
last speech, rough and imperative as it was,
that gave him a little feeling of security, so
far as he had been led to suspect any designs
on his property on the part of his companion.</p>

<p>Without venturing upon any further remonstrance,
which, it was clear, would prove
altogether useless, he shuffled up stairs, in
obedience to the stranger's command, yet not
without casting back over his shoulder a look
of apprehension, as if he feared an attack
from behind.</p>

<p>His visitor, perceiving this, smiled, as if
amused at old Peter's evident alarm.</p>

<p>Arrived at the head of the stairs, Peter
opened the door into the apartment appropriated
to his own use.</p>

<p>The stranger followed him in, and after a
leisurely glance about the room, seated himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
with some caution in a chair, which did
not look very secure.</p>

<p>Peter placed the flickering candle upon the
mantel-piece, and seated himself.</p>

<p>It was long, very long, since a visitor had
wakened the echoes of the old house; very
long since any human being, save Peter himself,
had been seated in that room. The old
man could not help feeling it to be a strange
thing, so unaccustomed was he to the sight of
any other human face there.</p>

<p>"It seems to me," said his visitor, dryly,
taking in at a glance all the appointments of
the room, "that you don't care much about
the luxuries of life."</p>

<p>"I," said Peter, "I'm obliged to live very
plain,&mdash;very plain, indeed,&mdash;because I am so
poor."</p>

<p>"Poor or not," said the visitor, "you must
afford to have a better fire while I am here.
I don't approve of freezing."</p>

<p>He rose without ceremony, and taking half
a dozen sticks from the hearth, deposited them
in the stove, which now contained only some
burning embers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>"Stay," said Peter, hastily. "Don't put so
much on; it's wasteful, and I sha'n't have any
left for to-morrow."</p>

<p>"I'll risk that," said the other, carelessly.
"At any rate, it's better to be comfortable
one day than to shiver through two."</p>

<p>The flame caught the wood, which soon
blazed up, diffusing an unusually cheerful
glow over the apartment. Peter, in spite of
the dismay with which he had at first contemplated
the sudden movement on the part of
his visitor, and the awful consumption of
wood which he knew must ensue, nevertheless
appeared to enjoy the increased heat. He
drew his chair nearer the stove, and an expression
of satisfaction was visible in his face
as he spread out both hands to catch a little
warmth.</p>

<p>"There, Peter," said the stranger, "I knew
you'd like it after it was fairly done. Isn't
it worth while to have a good warm fire?"</p>

<p>"If it didn't cost so much," groaned Peter,
the one thought intruding.</p>

<p>"Hush, Peter; if what people say be true,
and as I am inclined to believe, there's no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
one better able to afford a good fire than
you."</p>

<p>"No one better able!" repeated Peter, at
once taking alarm, and lifting up both hands
in earnest deprecation, "when I can hardly
get enough together to keep from absolute
starvation. Oh, it's a strange world, it's a
strange world!"</p>

<p>"Well, Peter, some strange people do live
in it, to be sure. But people do say, Peter,
that you have a power of money hidden away
in this old house somewhere."</p>

<p>Peter started to his feet in affright, then
feeling that his movement might lead to suspicion,
sank back into his seat, saying, uneasily,
"I only wish it were true. People say
such strange things. But it's only idle talk,
idle talk. They know better."</p>

<p>"You'd be very grateful, I have no doubt,
to anybody that would show you where all
these treasures are that people talk about,
wouldn't you, hey?"</p>

<p>"Ye&mdash;Yes," answered Peter Manson, who
did not know quite how to understand his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
companion, whose tone seemed to have a hidden
meaning which made him uneasy.</p>

<p>"And will you give me leave to search the
house, if I will promise to give you half the
gold I find?"</p>

<p>"But you wouldn't find any," answered the
miser, hastily.</p>

<p>"Then there would be no harm done. Suppose
now I should remove the flooring, just
here for instance, don't you think I might
possibly find something underneath that
would repay me for my search?"</p>

<p>Unconsciously the speaker had hit upon
one of Peter's places of deposit. Directly
under where he was seated there was a box
of gold coins. Accordingly this remark, which
seemed to indicate to Peter some knowledge
of his hiding-place, filled him with fearful
apprehensions.</p>

<p>"No, no," said he, vehemently; "go away,
there isn't any there. If that is all you
have got to say, go away and leave me to my
rest. I ought to be in bed; it is getting late."</p>

<p>"I <i>have</i> something more to say, Peter Manson,"
returned his companion. "If I had not,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
I should not have sought you to-night. What
I have to say is of great importance to you as
you will find. Will you hear it?"</p>

<p>"Go on," muttered Peter, his attention arrested,
in spite of his fears, by the stranger's
peculiar tone.</p>

<p>"First, then, let me tell you a story. It
may be real, it may be only fancy. I won't
say anything about that. By the way, Peter,
were you ever in the West Indies?"</p>

<p>This question produced a singular effect
upon Peter, considering its apparently unimportant
character. He started, turned as
pale as his ghastly complexion permitted,
fixed an anxious glance upon the stranger,
who looked as if nothing particular had happened,
and said hastily, "No, I was never
there. What made you ask?"</p>

<p>"Nothing particular," said the other, carelessly;
"if you were never there, no matter.
Only it is there that what I am going to tell
you happened. But to my story.</p>

<p>"Some twenty years ago there lived in the
city of Havana an American gentleman, no
matter about his name, who had established<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
himself in business in the city. He had
married before he went there, and had a
daughter about sixteen years of age. Well,
his business flourished. Good luck seemed to
attend him in all his ventures, and he seemed
likely to accumulate enough to retire upon
before many years."</p>

<p>Peter started, and as the story progressed
seemed to be internally agitated. A keen
glance satisfied his visitor of this; without
appearing to notice it, however, he went on,&mdash;</p>

<p>"But things don't always turn out as well
as we expect. Just when things looked
brightest there came a sudden blow, for
which the merchant was unprepared. On
going to his counting-room one morning, he
discovered that his book-keeper had disappeared,
and what was worse, had carried off
with him the sum of twenty thousand dollars&mdash;a
large sum, was it not?"</p>

<p>"What is all this to me?" demanded Peter,
with sudden fierceness.</p>

<p>"I will tell you by and by," said the stranger,
coolly.</p>

<p>"I will take the liberty to put a little more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
wood into the stove, and then go on with my
story."</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I'll put some in," said Peter.</p>

<p>He took a small stick about half as large
round as his wrist, and opening the stove-door,
put it in.</p>

<p>"That'll do to begin with," said the stranger,
following it, to Peter's dismay, with half
a dozen larger ones. "Now we'll be comfortable."</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>IV.<br /> <small>A STARTLING QUESTION.</small></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">While</span> Peter's uneasiness became every
moment more marked, his visitor continued,&mdash;</p>

<p>"This sad defalcation was the more unfortunate
because, on that very day notes to
a heavy amount became due. Of course the
merchant was unable to pay them. Do you
know what was the result?"</p>

<p>"How should I know?" asked Peter, testily,
avoiding the gaze of the stranger, and fixing
his eyes uneasily upon the fire.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>"Of course you couldn't know, I was
foolish to think such a thing."</p>

<p>"Then what made you think it?" said
Peter, in a petulant tone. "I don't care to
hear your story. What has it got to do with
me?"</p>

<p>"Don't be in too much of a hurry, and
perhaps you will learn quite as soon as you
care to. The same result followed, which
always does follow when a business man
cannot meet his engagements. He failed."</p>

<p>Peter stirred uneasily, but said nothing.</p>

<p>"His character for integrity was such that
there were many who would have lent him a
helping hand, and carried him safely through
his troubles; but he was overwhelmed by
the blow, and sank under it. Refusing all
offers of assistance, he took to his bed, and
some six months after died."</p>

<p>"And what became of his daughter?"
asked Peter, showing a little curiosity for the
first time.</p>

<p>"Ha! you seem to be getting interested,"
exclaimed the other, fixing his keen eyes upon
Peter, who seemed confused. "His daughter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
was beautiful and had already won the heart
of a young American, who had little money
but a handsome figure and good business
habits."</p>

<p>"Did she marry this young Codman?"</p>

<p>"Who told you his name was Codman?"
asked Peter's visitor, watching him keenly.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I thought you did," stammered the
miser, disconcerted.</p>

<p>"You are mistaken. I have mentioned no
name."</p>

<p>"Then I&mdash;I must have misunderstood
you."</p>

<p>"I dare say," said the other, ironically.
"However, we won't dispute that point.
Well, this young Codman,&mdash;for singularly
enough you hit upon the right name, not
knowing anything of the circumstances of
course,&mdash;this young Codman married Isabel."</p>

<p>"Isabel!" repeated the old man. "Her
name was&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Here he paused in sudden confusion, feeling
that he was betraying himself by his incautious
correction.</p>

<p>"Yes, Peter," said the other with a shrewd<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
smile, "you are right. Her name was not
Isabel, but Eleanor. I acknowledge that I
was wrong; but it seems to me that, for one
who is entirely a stranger to the events I have
been describing, you show a wonderful
shrewdness in detecting my mistakes."</p>

<p>Peter maintained a confused silence, and
wriggled about uneasily, as if the stranger's
fixed and watchful gaze disturbed him.</p>

<p>"Humph! well they say that some people
have the gift of second sight, and others can
see through millstones, and various other
wonderful things."</p>

<p>"What has all this to do with me?" asked
Peter, crossly, for he felt it necessary to make
some demonstration. "It's getting late, and
I want to go to bed. Go away, and&mdash;and
come again to-morrow, if you want to."</p>

<p>"A bird in the hand is worth two in the
bush, Peter, which means that I am sure of you
now, and perhaps you wouldn't let me in if I
should call to-morrow. If you are sleepy
I have no objection to your going to bed. I
can talk to you as well as if you were sitting
up. I will stay here and keep the fire going."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>Peter looked at the small pile of wood with
a groan, and muttered something about "its
being awful extravagant to keep such a fire."</p>

<p>"I believe," said the stranger, "I have not
yet told you the name of the defaulted clerk."</p>

<p>Peter said nothing.</p>

<p>"It was Thornton, but his first name was
Peter, the same as yours. Singular, isn't it,
Peter?"</p>

<p>"I suppose there are a good many Peters
in the world," muttered the old man.</p>

<p>"Very likely; though I hope most of them
are better than this Peter Thornton. He got
off without being taken, with the twenty
thousand dollars in his possession. He was
fond of money, and many thought this explained
the defalcation. However, there were
not wanting others who assigned a different
motive. It was said that he had been smitten
by the youthful charms of his employer's
daughter Eleanor, who did not favor his suit."</p>

<p>Peter shifted uneasily in his chair.</p>

<p>"No one could blame her. In fact it was
perfectly preposterous for him to think of
mating with her. Did you speak?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>"No!" snarled Peter.</p>

<p>"I thought you said something. I repeat,
that she had plenty of reasons for rejecting
him. She was just sixteen, and beautiful as
she was young, and had no lack of admirers
ready to devote themselves to her. As for
Peter Thornton, ha! ha! he never could have
been very handsome, from all I have heard of
him. In the first place, he was forty or
more."</p>

<p>"Thirty-eight," muttered Peter, below his
breath.</p>

<p>"And his features were irregular, besides
being marked with the small-pox, which he
had had in early life. He had a long, hooked
nose like a bird's beak, an enormous mouth,
little sharp gray eyes like a ferret's, and his
hair was already mingled with gray. On the
whole, he hadn't much beauty to boast of.
Did you say anything?"</p>

<p>"No!" snarled Peter, sourly. He was sitting
with his elbows on his knees, and his
face resting on his hands.</p>

<p>"Beg pardon, I thought you spoke. To
add to Peter's charms of person, his disposition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
was not the sweetest that ever was. He
had a harsh and crabbed manner, which would
have led to his discharge if he had not had
one saving trait. I will say, to his credit,
that he was a capital book-keeper. Of his
honesty his employer thought he was well
assured, and probably if nothing had occurred
of a character to wound Peter's pride, he
might have continued faithful to his trust.
One day, however, Peter took an opportunity,
when he had been calling at the house of his
employer on business connected with the
counting-room, to declare his love to the
young lady, whom he found alone in the
drawing-room. You can imagine how much
she was amused&mdash;why don't you laugh, Peter?
You look as glum as if it were <i>you</i> that had
met with this disappointment. The young
lady told him plainly, as soon as she got over
her astonishment, that she could give him no
encouragement whatever. Perhaps there
might have been in her tone something of the
aversion which it was natural for her to feel
at such a proposition from one so much beneath
her. If they had married, it would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
have been a second case of Beauty and the
Beast. Beg pardon, Peter, I believe you said
something."</p>

<p>"No!" snarled Peter, fiercely. "Have you
got nearly through? Your story is nothing
to me&mdash;nothing, I say. I want to go to bed.
You have kept me up too late already."</p>

<p>"I can't help that, Peter. It took me too
long to get in for me to resign readily the
pleasure of your society. I say, Peter, what
a jolly good fellow you are,&mdash;quite a lively
companion,&mdash;only it strikes me you might be
a little more civil to your company. It isn't
exactly polite to keep telling one how anxious
you are for him to go.</p>

<p>"As I was saying, when you interrupted
me, Eleanor told Peter very decidedly that
she could not for an instant entertain his suit.
He endeavored to change her determination,
being an ardent, impulsive lover, and probably
in her impatience she said something which
irritated her lover, who went off in a rage.
After a while, however, he was foolish enough
to open the subject again. Of course she was
extremely annoyed at his persistence, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
seeing no other way of escaping the persecution,
she felt it necessary to acquaint her father
with what had transpired. The merchant
was naturally indignant at his book-keeper's
presumption, and calling him aside one morning
threatened to discharge him from his
employment unless he should forthwith desist.
This was, of course, a great blow to Peter's
pride. He had the good sense to say nothing,
however, but none the less determined within
himself to be revenged upon those who had
scorned his advances, as soon as an opportunity
offered. I don't know as I blame him.
Perhaps I should have done the same under
similar circumstances."</p>

<p>There was a trace of agitation upon the
pale and wrinkled countenance of the miser.</p>

<p>"This it was," continued the stranger,
"taken in connection with Peter's natural cupidity
that led to the defalcation I have
mentioned. So far as the merchant was concerned
his revenge was completely successful,
for he was the means of his ruin and premature
death. And now, Peter," he added,
suddenly changing his tone, "can you tell me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
what induced you to change your name from
Thornton to Manson?"</p>

<p>"Me!" exclaimed the miser, starting to his
feet in consternation, and glaring wildly at
the speaker.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter">
<h2>V.<br /> <small>THE COMPACT.</small></h2>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Yes</span>," said the stranger, composedly; "I
repeat the question, why did you change your
name to Manson?"</p>

<p>"What&mdash;do&mdash;you&mdash;mean?" the old man
faltered slowly.</p>

<p>"I mean just what I say, and I see you understand
me well enough."</p>

<p>"You can't prove it," said Peter, with an
uneasy glance at his imperturbable companion.</p>

<p>"Can't I? Perhaps not. I should say the
mysterious knowledge you seem to possess of
the main incidents in my story would prove
something."</p>

<p>"That isn't evidence in a court of law,"
said Peter, regaining a degree of confidence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<p>"Perhaps not; but I say, Peter, don't you
recognize me?"</p>

<p>The old man scanned his features eagerly,
and a sudden look of remembrance satisfied
the latter that he was not forgotten.</p>

<p>"I see you do remember me," he said; "I
thought you hadn't forgotten John Randall.
At any rate he hasn't forgotten you, though
twenty years have passed, and I was then but
a young man. I used to see you too often
about the streets of Havana not to remember
that hooked nose, those gray eyes, and (excuse
my plainness of speech) that large mouth.
Yes, Peter, your features are impressed upon
my memory too indelibly to be effaced."</p>

<p>Peter Manson remembered his companion as
one who had had the reputation of being a
"wild" young man. He had been placed at
school by his father without any profitable
result. On his father's death he squandered,
in dissipation, the property which came to
him, and had since devoted himself to the sea.</p>

<p>"Having settled this little matter of your
identity," continued Randall, "I am ready to
finish my story. I told you that Eleanor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
married the young man whose name you remembered
so well. He was poor, dependent
upon his salary as a clerk, and thanks to you
his wife had nothing to hope from her father.
They were obliged to live in a very humble
way. At length, thinking he could do better
here, he removed to Boston, where his early
life had been spent."</p>

<p>"To Boston!" muttered Peter.</p>

<p>"The removal took place some six years
since. They had three children when they
first came here, but two died, leaving only the
second, a boy, named Charlie. I should think
he might be fourteen years of age. And now,
would you like to know if the husband is still
living?"</p>

<p>"Is he?" asked Peter, looking up.</p>

<p>"No. He died about a year since, of a
fever."</p>

<p>"And&mdash;and Eleanor? What of her?"</p>

<p>"For six months past she has been a tenant
of yours."</p>

<p>"A tenant of mine!" exclaimed the miser.</p>

<p>"It is even so. She occupies a second-story
room in the tenement-house in&mdash;&mdash;Street."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>"And I have met her face to face?"</p>

<p>"I dare say you have. Your tenants are
pretty sure to have that pleasure once a
month. But doesn't it seem strange that
Eleanor Gray, the beautiful daughter of your
Havana employer, should after these twenty
years turn up in Boston the tenant of her
father's book-keeper?"</p>

<p>"Ha! ha!" chuckled the miser, hoarsely,
"she isn't so much better off than if she had
married old Peter."</p>

<p>"As to being better off," said Randall, "I
presume she is better off, though she can't
call a hundred dollars her own, than if she
were installed mistress of your establishment.
Faugh! Poorly as she is obliged to
live, it is luxury, compared with your establishment."</p>

<p>He glanced about him with a look of disgust.</p>

<p>"If you don't like it," said Peter, querulously,
"there is no use of your staying. It
is past my bedtime."</p>

<p>"I shall leave you in a few minutes, Peter,
but I want to give you something to think of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
first. Don't you see that your property is in
danger of slipping from your hands?"</p>

<p>"My property in danger!" exclaimed
Peter, wildly; "what do you mean; where is
the danger?" Then, his voice sinking to its
usual whine,&mdash;"not that I have any of any
consequence, I am poor&mdash;very poor."</p>

<p>"Only from what I see I could easily
believe it, but I happen to know better."</p>

<p>"Indeed, I am&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No more twaddle about poverty," said
Randall, decidedly, "it won't go down. I am
not so easily deceived as you may imagine.
I know perfectly well that you are worth
at the very least, thirty thousand dollars."</p>

<p>"Thirty thousand dollars!" exclaimed the
miser, raising both hands in astonishment.</p>

<p>"Yes, Peter, and I don't know but I may
say forty thousand. Why, it can't be otherwise,
with your habits. Twenty years ago
you made off with twenty thousand, which
has been accumulating ever since. Your
personal expenses haven't made very large
inroads upon your income, judging from your
scarecrow appearance. So much the worse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
for you. You might have got some good
from it. Now it must go to others."</p>

<p>"To others!" exclaimed Peter, turning
pale.</p>

<p>"Certainly. You don't think the law
gives you whatever you've a mind to steal,
do you? Of course there is no doubt that to
your tenants, Eleanor and Charlie Codman,
belongs this property which you wrongfully
hold."</p>

<p>"They sha'n't have it. They never shall
have it," said Peter Manson, hastily.</p>

<p>"Well, perhaps the law may have something
to say about that."</p>

<p>"My gold!" groaned the miser. "If I lose
that I lose everything. It will be my death.
Good Mr. Randall, have pity upon me. I am
sure you won't say anything that&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Will bring you to state's prison," said
Randall, coolly.</p>

<p>"They&mdash;Eleanor and her son&mdash;need never
know it."</p>

<p>"Unless I tell them."</p>

<p>"But you won't."</p>

<p>"That depends upon circumstances. How<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
much will you give me to keep the thing
secret?"</p>

<p>"What will I give you?"</p>

<p>"Precisely. That is what I have been so
long in coming at. You see, Peter, that the
secret is worth something. Either I reveal it
to the parties interested, in which case I
wouldn't give that," snapping his fingers,
"for your chance of retaining the property,
or I keep silence <i>if you make it worth my
while</i>."</p>

<p>"Pity me," said the miser, abjectly, sinking
on his knees before Randall; "pity me and
spare my gold."</p>

<p>"Pity you!" said Randall, contemptuously.
"Why didn't you pity your employer? You
must make up your mind to pay me my
price."</p>

<p>"I am very poor," whined Peter, in his
customary phrase, "and I can't pay much."</p>

<p>"Oh yes, Peter," said the other, sarcastically,
"I am well aware that you are poor,&mdash;wretchedly
poor,&mdash;and I won't be too hard upon
you."</p>

<p>"Thank you&mdash;thank you," said Peter,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
catching at this promise; "I will give you
something&mdash;a little&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"How much?" asked Randall, with some
curiosity.</p>

<p>"Ten dollars!" said the miser, with the
air of a man who named a large sum.</p>

<p>"Ten dollars!" returned Randall, with a
laugh of derision. "Ten dollars to secure
the peaceable possession of thirty thousand!
Old man, you must be mad, or you must
think that I am."</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I did not mean to offend," said the old
man, humbly. "If I double the sum will it
satisfy you? I&mdash;I will try to raise it, though
it will be hard&mdash;very hard."</p>

<p>"This is mere trifling, Peter Manson," said
his visitor, decidedly. "Twenty dollars!
Why I wouldn't have come across the street
to get it. No, you will have to elevate your
ideas considerably."</p>

<p>"How much do you demand?" said the
miser, groaning internally, and fixing his eyes
anxiously upon Randall.</p>

<p>"You must not make a fuss when I name
the amount."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>"Name it," said Peter, in a choking voice.</p>

<p>"One thousand dollars will purchase my
silence, and not a dollar less."</p>

<p>Peter sprang from his seat in consternation.</p>

<p>"One thousand dollars! Surely you are
not in earnest."</p>

<p>"But I am, though. This is not a subject
I care to jest upon."</p>

<p>"One thousand dollars! It will take all I
have and leave me a beggar."</p>

<p>"If it should, Peter," said his visitor, composedly,
"I will procure you admission to the
poor-house, where, if I am not much mistaken
you will be better off than in this tumble-down
old shanty."</p>

<p>"Has the man no mercy?" groaned Peter,
wringing his hands.</p>

<p>"None at all."</p>

<p>"Then," exclaimed the miser, in a sudden
fit of desperation, "I won't pay you a cent&mdash;not
a single cent."</p>

<p>"That is your final determination, is
it?"</p>

<p>"Ye&mdash;yes," muttered Peter, but less firmly.</p>

<p>"Very well. I will tell you the result. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
shall at once go to Eleanor, and inform her of
the good fortune which awaits her. No fear
but she will pay me a thousand dollars for
the intelligence."</p>

<p>"She has no money."</p>

<p>"I will furnish her with money for the
lawyers&mdash;she can repay me out of your
hoards."</p>

<p>Peter groaned.</p>

<p>"Ay, groan away, Peter. You'll have
cause enough to groan, by and by. There is
one thing you don't seem to consider, that
the law will do something more than take
away your property. I will come to see you
in jail."</p>

<p>He rose to leave the room, but Peter called
him back hastily. "We may come to terms
yet," he said.</p>

<p>"Then you accede to my terms."</p>

<p>"I will give you five hundred."</p>

<p>"Good-night, Peter. I wish you happy
dreams."</p>

<p>"St-stay!" exclaimed Peter, terrified. "I
will give eight hundred."</p>

<p>"I am in something of a hurry," said Randall.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
"I believe I will call on Eleanor.
I don't think we can make any arrangement."</p>

<p>"Hold! perhaps I will do as you say."</p>

<p>"Ah! now you are beginning to be reasonable,"
said Randall, resuming his seat.</p>

<p>"What security can you give me for your
silence?"</p>

<p>"I'll tell you what I will do, Peter. You
remember I told you Eleanor had a son, a
boy of fourteen."</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"His mother is quite devoted to him. Indeed,
he contributes to her support by selling
papers, and by various little jobs. Now, as
long as Eleanor lives here you are in danger."</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"And if a blow is levelled at her it must
be through her boy."</p>

<p>"I see."</p>

<p>"Then I'll tell you of a scheme I have arranged.
You must first know that I am
mate of a vessel now in port, which is bound
for San Francisco. We are to sail in a few
days."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"We happen to be in want of a boy to fill
up our regular number. Suppose I kidnap
Eleanor's boy. Don't you see, that as he is
her chief support, she will soon be in difficulties?
and this, with her uncertainty
about her boy's fate, may rid you of your
greatest peril, and the only one of the two
who could identify you."</p>

<p>"Excellent, excellent!" chuckled Peter,
rubbing his hands; "she shall yet be sorry
that she rejected old Peter."</p>

<p>"Am I to understand that you accede to
my proposal, then?"</p>

<p>Not without many groans Peter agreed to
deliver the sum mentioned between them, on
condition that the boy was secured.</p>

<p>It was striking ten when Randall left the
house. His face beamed with exultation.</p>

<p>"I have done a good night's work," he said.
"By working on the fears of the old curmudgeon
I have made sure of a thousand dollars.
He will be lucky if this is the last money I
get out of him. He little thinks that I, too,
have a revenge to wreak. He is not the only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
one that has been scornfully rejected by
Eleanor Codman. Now to bed, and to-morrow
shall see my work commenced."</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>VI.<br /> <small>CHARLIE AT HOME.</small></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> tenement-house owned by Peter Manson
was a three-story wooden building, very
much in need of paint. It was scarcely likely
to be pointed out by any one as one of the
architectural ornaments of the city. Years
before it had fallen into Peter's hands at a
small price, and he had every year since realized
from it in the way of rent a sum equal
to one half the purchase-money. No one who
has lived in a city can help knowing how
much more proportionally the poor are compelled
to pay for their scanty and insufficient
accommodations than the rich, or those in moderate
circumstances. No class of property
is made to pay a larger percentage than the
wretched tenement-houses which seem adapted
to furnish as little accommodation as possible
to those who are compelled to occupy them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>The tenement-house in which Charlie and
his mother lived was no better than the average.
It was the home of a large number of
persons of various occupations. Seamstresses,
mechanics, washer-women, and many others
found a home under this one roof.</p>

<p>Mrs. Codman occupied a room on the third
floor. As we enter the room it is easy to see
what a charm can be thrown around even the
humblest place by the presence of refinement
and good taste. All the appointments of the
room, indeed, were of the cheapest description.
Probably the furniture did not exceed
in cost that of the room opposite. Yet there
was a considerable difference in the appearance
of Mrs. Codman's room and that of Sally
Price, who, if she had ever possessed an organ
of neatness, had lost it years ago.</p>

<p>The old-fashioned windows were washed as
clean as water could make them, so as to
admit all the sunshine which could find its
way over the tall roof on the opposite side of
the street. They were hung with plain chintz
curtains, separated in the middle and looped
on either side. The floor was quite clean as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
far as it could be seen. In the centre was
spread a floor-cloth some eight feet square,
which relieved its bareness. There was a
small round table near the window, and a
small square work-table of no very costly material,
in another part of the room. On this
was placed a rose-bush in a flower-pot. It
had been given to Charlie by an old gentleman
who had taken a fancy to him. In another
quarter was a home-made lounge, the
work of Charlie's hands. It had originally
been a wooden box, given him by a shopkeeper
near by. This box had been covered
with calico stuffed with cotton, so that it
made quite a comfortable seat. It was used
besides as a wood-box, its legitimate province,
but when the cover was closed it was nevertheless
a very respectable article of furniture.
There were besides a few plain wooden chairs,
and a small rocking-chair for Mrs. Codman.
Opening out of the main room was a small
bedroom, occupied by the mother, while
Charlie had a bed made up for him at night
in the common sitting-room.</p>

<p>A few books&mdash;a very few&mdash;were piled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
upon the little table. They were chiefly schoolbooks,&mdash;an
arithmetic, a geography, and an
atlas, over which Charlie would generally
spend a portion of every evening, and occasionally
a boy's book, lent him by his friend
Edwin Bangs, who, together with his brothers,
had quite a large juvenile library.</p>

<p>Mrs. Codman is sitting by the window industriously
engaged in needle-work, and intent
on accomplishing a certain amount before
nightfall. She was past thirty-five, yet, in
spite of the trials which have left their impress
on her brow, she would readily be taken
for five years younger. She has drawn her
chair to the window to make the most of
the rapidly fading daylight. As with swift
fingers she plies the glistening needle, and the
sun touches her cheek with a beaming glow,
we can see that not only has she been beautiful,
but is still so.</p>

<p>A hasty step is heard on the stairs, there is
a stamping at the door, and in rushes a bright,
handsome boy, with rosy cheeks and dark
hair.</p>

<p>The mother's face lights up with a bright<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
smile as she turns to her son, the only one
she has left to love.</p>

<p>"You're a little later than usual, Charlie,
are you not?"</p>

<p>"A little, mother. You see I didn't get a
job till late, and then two came together."</p>

<p>"What were they?"</p>

<p>"A gentleman wanted me to take his carpet-bag
from the Maine depot, and I had to
carry it away up to Rutland Street."</p>

<p>"Did he go with you?"</p>

<p>"No; he had to go to his counting-room in
State Street."</p>

<p>"Was he willing to trust you? Some
boys might have made off with the carpet-bag,
and he would have never seen it
again."</p>

<p>"He thought of that, but he said&mdash;and I
think he's a real gentleman&mdash;that he knew I
was honest by my appearance, and he was
willing to trust me."</p>

<p>"Quite complimentary, Charlie. How much
did he pay you for your trouble?"</p>

<p>"Half a dollar."</p>

<p>"Then you have done a good deal better<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
than I have. I have been working all day,
and shall not realize more than twenty-five
cents for my labor."</p>

<p>"I wish you didn't have to work at all,
mother."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Charlie; but I dare say I am
happier for having something to do. I wish
I could get better pay for my work. But
you haven't told me what the other errand
was. You said you had two."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Charlie, "I had just got back
from Rutland Street, and had bought two or
three evening papers which I was going to
try to sell, when a man came up to me, and
after looking at me for a minute or two, asked
me if I would take a little walk with him.
He said he was a stranger in Boston, and
didn't know his way about much. He asked
me if I had lived here long, and what my
name was. He told me he would pay me if
I would go around with him, and point out
some of the public buildings. He told me he
would pay me at the rate of twenty-five cents
an hour for my time. I told him I had one
or two papers to dispose of."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p>"'Never mind about them,' said he, 'I will
take them off your hands.'</p>

<p>"'But they are alike,' said I.</p>

<p>"'Never mind,' he answered; so he paid me
the full price for two Journals and two Transcripts,
and off we went."</p>

<p>"What sort of a person was he?"</p>

<p>"He was a stout man, over forty, and looked
to me like a sailor. I shouldn't wonder if he
was an officer of some ship."</p>

<p>"Did you like his looks?"</p>

<p>"Why," said Charlie, hesitatingly, "not
exactly; not so much as I did of the other
gentleman. There was something about his
eye which I didn't like. Still he acted up to
his agreement, and paid me all he promised."</p>

<p>"How long were you together?"</p>

<p>"About an hour and a half. We walked
round the Common and the Public Garden,
went into the State House and the Public
Library. However, he didn't seem to care
much about them. He seemed to take more
interest in me, somehow, and asked me a
good many questions; whether I had any
parents living, and how long I had lived in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
the city. When I told him you were born
in Havana, he said he used to live there himself."</p>

<p>"Indeed!" said Mrs. Codman.</p>

<p>"He also told me that he might like to
have me go round with him again, and told
me to call to-morrow at the Quincy House,
where he is stopping. But, mother, isn't it
most time for supper? Here, just let me set
the table, if you are busy."</p>

<p>"Very well, Charlie; I shall be glad to
have you do so, as I am in a hurry to finish
my sewing."</p>

<p>In the evening Charlie read to his mother
while she sewed. Neither of them suspected
that it was the last evening they would spend
together for several months.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>VII.<br /> <small>CAPTAIN BRACE.</small></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Lying</span> at one of the wharves was a ship of
moderate size, evidently fast getting ready
for sea. The cargo had all been stowed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
away, and, notwithstanding the confusion, it
was easy even for a landsman to see that the
ship was about ready for departure.</p>

<p>The ship was the Bouncing Betsey, commanded
by Captain Nathaniel Brace. As to
the peculiar name of the vessel, I can give no
information whether or not there was a real
Bouncing Betsey after whom it was named.
The probability however is, that it was a
purely ideal name, the sound and alliterative
character of which had commended it to the
one upon whom rested the selection of a
name.</p>

<p>A few words now about Captain Brace,
with whom we shall become better acquainted
by and by.</p>

<p>He was a short, stout, broad-shouldered
man. He was no fresh-water captain, but
from the age of thirteen had been tossing
about on the ocean. It is my privilege to
know many sea captains who do honor to
their calling, high-toned, gentlemanly, and
intelligent men; not learned in books, but
possessing a wide range of general information.
I am sorry to say that Captain Brace<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
was not a man of this class. He had little
education beyond what was required by his
profession, and was utterly lacking in refinement
and courtesy. He was not an amiable
man, but rough, stormy, exacting, and dictatorial.
The crew under his command he
looked upon as so many machines, whose
duty it was to obey him with scrupulous
exactness, whatever might be the nature of
his requisitions. When he got into one of
his fits of passion, he would stamp and rave,
kicking and striking this way and that with
the most reckless disregard of human lives
and human feelings. In fact, he was one of
those pests of the merchant service, an unfeeling
tyrant, who did all in his power to
degrade the profession which he had adopted,
and add to the hardships which lie in the
path of the sailor.</p>

<p>The employers of Captain Brace were far
from being aware of the extent to which he
carried the severity of his discipline; brutality,
indeed, would be the more appropriate
word. They supposed him to be a strict
commander, who liked to preserve a proper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
subordination in those under his command,
and this they were disposed to commend
rather than to complain of, more especially as
the captain was master of his profession, and
had usually made quick and profitable
voyages. This, as may be supposed, was
enough to cover a great many defects in the
eyes of those whose pecuniary interest he
subserved, even if the captain had not been
shrewd enough to conceal his more disagreeable
traits when on shore, under an affectation
of bluff frankness.</p>

<p>There was a time when there were many
captains in the service no better than the one
we have just sketched, but both in the naval
and merchant service there has undoubtedly
been a great improvement within a few years.</p>

<p>Without dwelling further on the personal
characteristics of Captain Brace, with whom
we shall have abundant opportunity to become
acquainted, since we purpose going to
sea with him on his approaching voyage, we
introduce him pacing the deck of his vessel
with a short black pipe in his mouth, on the
very morning he intends to sail.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>"Where is Mr. Randall? has he come on
board?" he inquired, turning to the second
mate.</p>

<p>"No, sir; I have not seen him this morning,"
was the reply.</p>

<p>"When he comes on board tell him I wish
to see him immediately."</p>

<p>"Very well, sir."</p>

<p>The captain went to his cabin, and about
five minutes later the individual after whom
he inquired came aboard. We recognize in
him an old acquaintance; no other than the
nocturnal visitor who excited such fearful
apprehensions in the mind of old Peter Manson
the miser.</p>

<p>"Where is Captain Brace, Mr. Bigelow?"
he inquired of the second mate.</p>

<p>"In the cabin, Mr. Randall. He wishes to
see you."</p>

<p>"And I wish to see him, so we can suit
each other's convenience. How long since
did he ask for me?"</p>

<p>"Only two or three minutes. He has just
gone below."</p>

<p>"Then he hasn't had long to wait."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p>With these words he hastened to the cabin,
where he found the captain waiting for him.</p>

<p>The subject on which the captain wished
to see his first mate was purely of a professional
and technical character, and will not
be likely to interest the reader, and so will be
passed over.</p>

<p>When this preliminary matter was disposed
of, Randall, with a little hesitation, remarked:
"I have a little favor to ask of you, Captain
Brace."</p>

<p>"Very well, sir; let me know what it is,
and if I can conveniently grant it I will."</p>

<p>"The boy who had engaged to go with us
has backed out, having heard some ridiculous
stories about your severity and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The captain's brow grew dark with anger
as he said:</p>

<p>"The young rascal! I should like to overhaul
him! I'd show him what it is to see
service!"</p>

<p>There is very little doubt that the captain
would have kept his word.</p>

<p>Randall took care not to inform his superior
officer that he had privately communicated to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
the mother of the boy intelligence of his
severity, not from any motives of humanity,
but simply because his going would have
interfered with his own plans in respect to
Charlie.</p>

<p>"We shall not have much time to hunt up
a boy if we sail at three o'clock," said the
captain. "I don't see but we must go without
one."</p>

<p>"I think I can supply you with one, Captain
Brace."</p>

<p>"Ha! who is it?"</p>

<p>"It's a nephew of mine, and the favor I
spoke of was that you should take him in
place of the boy we have missed of."</p>

<p>"Humph!" said the captain, "there is one
objection I have to taking relations of the
officers. You are expected to be tender of
them, and not order them about as roughly as
the rest."</p>

<p>"There won't be any trouble of that sort in
this case, Captain Brace, you may be very
sure," said the mate. "Although the boy is
my nephew I don't feel any very extraordinary
affection for him."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>"I should think not," said the captain, with
a grim smile, "from your efforts to get him a
place on board this ship. You're not any
more gentle with boys than I am."</p>

<p>"The fact is, Captain Brace," said Randall,
with a smile which evinced a thorough understanding
of the captain's meaning; "the fact
is, the boy is unruly, and they can't do much
for him at home, and I thought it might be
well for him to try a voyage or two, <i>for the
benefit of his health</i>!"</p>

<p>The mate smiled, and as it was such a joke
as the captain could appreciate, he smiled
too.</p>

<p>"Very well, Mr. Randall; if such are your
views I have no objection to his coming on
board."</p>

<p>"I had fears," continued the mate, "that
his unruly temper would interfere with his
usefulness at home. I felt pretty sure we
could soon cure him of that."</p>

<p>"<i>Kill or cure</i>, that is my motto," said the
captain.</p>

<p>"Sometimes both," thought Randall, remembering
one boy in a previous voyage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
who had languished and died under the cruel
treatment he experienced on board.</p>

<p>"Does the boy know he is to go with us?"
inquired the captain.</p>

<p>"Bless you, no; not he! He'd make a fuss
if he did."</p>

<p>"How do you intend to get him on board,
then?"</p>

<p>"I shall invite him to come and see the
vessel, and when he is down below I can take
care that he stays there till we are fairly at
sea."</p>

<p>"A good plan. What is the youngster's
name, Mr. Randall?"</p>

<p>"Jack Randall; named after me."</p>

<p>"Humph! hope he'll do credit to the
name," said the captain, grimly. "I leave in
your hands all the steps necessary to securing
him. Remember, if you please, that we shall
sail at three."</p>

<p>"I will be on board before that time, sir,
and bring my nephew with me."</p>

<p>"Very well, sir."</p>

<p>Of course the reader has conjectured that
the Jack Randall, the mate's nephew, spoken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
of above, is no other than our young hero,
Charlie Codman.</p>

<p>Poor boy! little does he dream of the plot
that is being formed against him.</p>

<h2>VIII.<br /> <small>THE BLUE CHEST.</small></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">On</span> leaving the Bouncing Betsey, Mr. John
Randall, the estimable mate of that vessel,
bent his steps towards a shop devoted to sailors'
clothing ready-made, with a large variety
of other articles such as seamen are accustomed
to require.</p>

<p>It was a shop of very good dimensions, but
low studded and rather dark, the windows,
which were few, being in part covered up by
articles hung in front of them.</p>

<p>The proprietor of this establishment was
Moses Mellen, a little Jew, with a countenance
clearly indicating his Israelitish descent. His
small black eyes sparkled with the greed of
gain, and he had a long, hooked nose like the
beak of a bird, which would not have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
considered too small an appendage for a face
of twice the size. He had one qualification
for a successful trader&mdash;he seldom or never
forgot a face which he had once seen.</p>

<p>Rubbing his hands with a great show of
cordiality, and with his face wreathed in
smiles, the instant he espied Randall he hastened
to meet him.</p>

<p>"Delighted to see you, Mr. Randall," he
exclaimed; "perhaps I ought to say Captain
Randall."</p>

<p>"Not yet."</p>

<p>"Ah well, that will come soon. I hope you
have had a prosperous voyage."</p>

<p>"Tolerably so, Mr. Mellen."</p>

<p>"Have you just arrived in the city, or have
you been here for some time?"</p>

<p>"Three weeks only, and now I am off again.
We sailors don't have a chance to stop long
on dry land, Mr. Mellen."</p>

<p>"Not if they are such capital sailors as my
friend, Mr. Randall. But where are you
bound this time?"</p>

<p>"Probably to Valparaiso."</p>

<p>"Anywhere else?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<p>"Perhaps so. We may go to the Indies or
Sandwich Islands before we return."</p>

<p>"A long voyage,&mdash;you will need to be
fitted out before you start,&mdash;don't you want
something in my line? I sha'n't want much
profit out of an old friend like you."</p>

<p>This, by the way, was what Moses said to
pretty much all his customers.</p>

<p>"I shall want a few things. I will pick
them out now."</p>

<p>"This way, then."</p>

<p>Randall followed the proprietor to the back
of the store, where he selected a variety of
articles, which he ordered sent on board the
Bouncing Betsey immediately.</p>

<p>"Now," said the mate, after his own purchases
were completed, "I shall require a
small outfit for a boy who is going out with
us."</p>

<p>"If you had brought him with you we
could have furnished him at short order."</p>

<p>"There was one little difficulty in the way
of my doing that."</p>

<p>"Eh?"</p>

<p>"He doesn't know he is going."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ah ha!" said the Jewish dealer, putting
one scraggy finger to the side of his nose with
a knowing look; "that's it, is it?"</p>

<p>"I see you comprehend. Now tell me what
shall we do about fitting him?"</p>

<p>"If I could only see him&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You could judge by your eye what would
be likely to fit him. Is that what you would
say?"</p>

<p>"Precisely."</p>

<p>"And how long would you require to look
at him?"</p>

<p>"Two minutes would answer."</p>

<p>"Very well; I will call with the boy in the
course of an hour or two. By the way, I
shall want a small chest to put the articles in.
You keep them, of course?"</p>

<p>"A great variety."</p>

<p>"I dare say you will suit me. A very plain
one will answer. Have your bill made out
for the other articles, and I will discharge it."</p>

<p>With a profusion of bows and thanks, the
trader dismissed his customer.</p>

<p>The mate now betook himself to the hotel
where he had engaged Charlie to meet him at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
eleven o'clock. Charlie, who was always
punctual to his appointments, had already arrived,
and was looking over a newspaper in
the reading-room.</p>

<p>"So you are on hand, my boy," said Randall,
in a friendly manner.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"I am glad to find you punctual. Are you
ready to set out?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, quite ready."</p>

<p>Rather to keep up the boy's delusion as to
his designs, Randall suffered Charlie to guide
him to one or two places of public interest,
with which he was already more familiar than
his guide, and then suddenly proposed that
they should go down to the wharves.</p>

<p>"You must know, my lad," said he, "that
I am a sailor."</p>

<p>"I thought so, sir."</p>

<p>"What made you think so?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, sir; but I can generally tell
a sailor."</p>

<p>"Perhaps I haven't got my sea-legs off.
However, as I was saying, I am an officer on
board a ship lying at the wharf, and I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
just thought of a bundle I want brought from
the ship. If you will go with me and fetch
it, I will pay you at the same rate I promised
you for going about with me."</p>

<p>Of course Charlie had no objections. In
fact, although he had been on board ships at
the wharf, he had never been in company
with an officer, and he thought it possible
his companion might be willing to explain
to him the use of some parts which he
did not yet understand. Accordingly he gave
a ready assent to the mate's proposition, and
together they took their way to Long Wharf,
at which the ship was lying.</p>

<p>The shop kept by the Jew was, as a matter
of convenience and policy, located near the
wharves. It was not a general clothing-store,
but specially designed to supply seamen with
outfits.</p>

<p>"I have a little errand here," said Randall,
pausing before the shop of Moses Mellen.</p>

<p>"I can stop outside," said Charlie.</p>

<p>"You had better come in. You will see
where we sailors get our clothing."</p>

<p>Not suspecting any sinister design in this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
invitation, Charlie accepted it without more
ado, and followed Randall in. He looked
about him with some curiosity, not observing
that he too was an object of attention to the
Jewish dealer, whose quick eye detected
their entrance.</p>

<p>He went forward to meet Randall.</p>

<p>"You see the boy, do you?" asked the
mate, in a low voice.</p>

<p>"Is that the one?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Do you think you will be able to
fit him?"</p>

<p>"No doubt about it, though he is a little
smaller than the boys we usually fit out."</p>

<p>"Never mind if the clothes are a little large.
He'll be sure to grow to them, and a precise
fit isn't quite so important on the quarter-deck
as it might be on Washington Street. We
are not fashionable on board the Betsey, Mr.
Mellen."</p>

<p>The dealer laughed, showing some yellowish
tusks, which were evidently not supplied
by the dentist.</p>

<p>"Have you made out my bill?"</p>

<p>"Here it is."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>

<p>"While I am looking over it, will you pick
out such clothes as the boy will need?"</p>

<p>Darting a hasty glance at Charlie, to make
sure of his size, the dealer hurried to the rear
of the shop, and commenced selecting articles
which he laid away in a small blue chest.</p>

<p>The task was soon completed, and again he
came out to the front part of the store.</p>

<p>"All ready!" he said, in a low voice to
Randall.</p>

<p>"You have been quick. Here is the amount
of your bill. As to the chest, you may send
it on board the Bouncing Betsey without any
unnecessary delay."</p>

<p>"It shall be done, Mr. Randall. Have you
no further commands for us?"</p>

<p>"I believe not, to-day."</p>

<p>"You will remember our shop when you
are round again?"</p>

<p>"I won't forget you."</p>

<p>"You needn't accompany me to the door,
nor allude to my voyage," said Randall, in a
low voice, to the dealer. "Remember, I have
<i>him</i> with me."</p>

<p>Moses winked in a manner which by no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
means improved the expression of his not
very agreeable features.</p>

<p>"Now, my lad," said Randall, "we'll go
on board the vessel. Have you ever been on
board a ship?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, a good many times by myself,
but I never had any one to tell me the
different parts."</p>

<p>"I'll promise, then," said the mate, in a tone
whose significance was lost upon our hero at
the time, though he afterwards recalled it,
"that you shall know more about a vessel before
you leave this one."</p>

<p>"I thank you," said Charlie, considering
the offer a kind one.</p>

<p>They ascended the ladder and jumped upon
the deck of the vessel, which, though Charlie
knew it not, was to be his home for many a
weary day.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>IX.<br /> <small>ON BOARD.</small></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">At</span> the close of the last chapter we had got
our hero fairly on board the Bouncing Betsey,
on what he supposed to be a brief visit, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
which his companion had resolved should be
far otherwise.</p>

<p>Randall did not at first undeceive his youthful
attendant. He felt that it would hardly
be polite, as the ship was lying at the wharf
surrounded by other vessels, and the disturbance
and vigorous resistance which Charlie
would be apt to make when told what was in
store for him might attract a degree of attention
which might prove fatal to his plans.</p>

<p>They had scarcely set their feet upon deck,
when they encountered Captain Brace.</p>

<p>The mate glanced significantly at the boy
by his side, and carelessly put his finger to
his lips in token of silence, at the same time
saying, "A lad whom I have promised to initiate
into some of the mysteries of seamanship."</p>

<p>"He may find the knowledge useful to him
some time," said the captain, with a grim
smile. "Do you think you should like going
to sea, my lad?"</p>

<p>"No, sir," returned Charlie, promptly, "I
don't think I should."</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p>"I should get tired of seeing the sea all
the time."</p>

<p>"You would get used to it."</p>

<p>"I never should like it so well as the
land. Besides, I should not like to leave my
mother."</p>

<p>"Well, my lad, if you should ever change
your mind," said the captain, with a wicked
glance at Randall, "I hope you'll give me the
first offer of your services."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," said our hero, thinking the captain
very affable and polite, though, to be sure,
his appearance was hardly as prepossessing
as it might have been.</p>

<p>"The captain seems to be a very nice man,"
said he to Randall, after that officer had left
them.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," answered Randall, dryly, "a
very fine man the captain is. I'm glad you
like him."</p>

<p>"Have you been to sea a long time?" inquired
Charlie.</p>

<p>"Yes, I have been ever since I was a boy."</p>

<p>"Do you like it?"</p>

<p>"Very much. It seems like home to me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
now. I shouldn't be willing to live on land
for any length of time."</p>

<p>"Did you begin very young?"</p>

<p>"I was about sixteen. How old are you?"</p>

<p>"Almost fourteen. I shall be fourteen
next month."</p>

<p>"You are a very good size for your age."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Charlie, with boyish pride,
drawing himself up to his full height. Like
most boys, he liked to be told he was large
of his age.</p>

<p>"My father was quite a large man," added
our young hero.</p>

<p>"I know it," muttered Randall to himself,
as the handsome face and manly form of the
father rose before him. They were imprinted
more vividly upon his memory, because he
felt that it was these very advantages which
had enabled his rival to succeed in winning
the prize for which he had vainly contended.</p>

<p>"Did you speak?" said Charlie, hearing
indistinctly the words which his companion
muttered.</p>

<p>"No," said Randall, shortly. "But I
promised to show you something about the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
vessel. I suppose you know the names of
the masts."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"What do they call this?"</p>

<p>"This is the main-mast," answered Charlie,
promptly, "and the others are called the fore-mast
and mizzen-mast."</p>

<p>"That is right; I suppose the masts seem
high to you."</p>

<p>"Yes, very high," said Charlie, stretching
his neck to enable him to see the top.</p>

<p>"Then you don't think you should like to
go aloft?" said Randall, playing with him as
a cat plays with a mouse.</p>

<p>"I don't believe I could. It would make
me dizzy."</p>

<p>"You could do better than you think for,
if you were obliged to."</p>

<p>"Perhaps I might," said Charlie, doubtfully.
"Do the boys on board ship have to go up
there?"</p>

<p>"I had to when I was a boy."</p>

<p>"Wer'n't you afraid?"</p>

<p>"I suppose I was, but that didn't do any
good,&mdash;I had to go."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>"Wer'n't you afraid of losing your hold?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but it isn't often a boy loses his hold
going up the first time. He is so frightened
that he clings to the ropes with a pretty tight
grip. But after he gets used to it&mdash;and it
doesn't seem any worse than going up stairs&mdash;he
is apt to grow careless, and then there is
sometimes an accident."</p>

<p>"Then I suppose they fall on deck and
are instantly killed," said Charlie, shuddering.</p>

<p>"Not always, for when the ship is in progress
it leans a good deal, so that they are
more likely to fall overboard."</p>

<p>"And get drowned!"</p>

<p>"Sometimes. They can't always keep up
till assistance comes, especially if they can't
swim. Sometimes their fall is broken by the
rigging, and they manage to save themselves
by catching hold."</p>

<p>They visited other parts of the ship, and
Randall continued his explanations. The
sailors were all on board, at work in various
ways. They did not appear to notice the
mate and his young companion when they
passed, but Charlie, chancing to look behind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
him, observed one making a significant
gesture to another, which evidently referred
to them.</p>

<p>Our young hero mentally thought this not
very polite, but did not pay much attention
to it.</p>

<p>About this time a porter arrived from the
clothing-store already referred to, bringing a
small blue chest.</p>

<p>"This is the ship Bouncing Betsey, isn't
it?" he inquired.</p>

<p>"Yes," answered one of the sailors.</p>

<p>"I was told to bring this chest here,
then."</p>

<p>"Who is it for?"</p>

<p>"Jack Randall."</p>

<p>"That's the mate, you lubber. Why don't
you put a handle to his name?"</p>

<p>"No, it's for a boy."</p>

<p>"We haven't got any such boy aboard as I
knows on."</p>

<p>"There ain't two ships of this name, are
there?"</p>

<p>"Not as I ever heerd tell."</p>

<p>"Then this must be the ship. Where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
shall I stow this chest? I've got tired of
bringing it on my back."</p>

<p>"You'd better go and speak to the mate
about it. There he stands. Mayhap that's
the boy the kit belongs to."</p>

<p>The porter walked forward.</p>

<p>"Does this belong to you?" he asked,
laying down the chest.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Then it wasn't for a boy?"</p>

<p>"Yes," answered the mate, carelessly. "It
is for a nephew of mine who is going with us
this voyage."</p>

<p>"Is that the young gentleman?" asked
the porter, pointing to Charlie.</p>

<p>"He thinks you're my nephew," said
Randall, smiling. "A good joke, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"This young gentleman is only looking
about the ship a little," he answered. "He
don't think he should fancy going to sea."</p>

<p>"Beg pardon, I didn't know but he might
be the one."</p>

<p>"Oh, no, certainly not."</p>

<p>"Shall I leave the chest here?"</p>

<p>"Yes, anywhere. No, you may carry it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
below. Here," summoning one of the sailors,
"Show this man where to put this chest."</p>

<p>"So your nephew is going to sea," said
Charlie, with some curiosity.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Does he think he shall like to go?"</p>

<p>"I don't believe he thinks much about it."</p>

<p>"How large a boy is he?"</p>

<p>"I should think he was about as large
as you. Yes, come to think of it, I don't
believe there can be any difference between
you."</p>

<p>The joke was a cruel one, as Charlie found
to his cost, before long.</p>

<p>"Is he on board now?"</p>

<p>"I don't see him," said the mate, looking
in the opposite direction from where Charlie
was standing. "But I think he will be on
board very soon. Were you ever dressed in
sailor's clothes?"</p>

<p>"Never," said our hero.</p>

<p>"I wonder how you would look. You are
just about my nephew's size. Have you any
objection to trying on his clothes?"</p>

<p>Charlie had not. In fact he was rather<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
curious to learn how he should look in this
unusual attire. Accordingly he went below,
and was soon dressed in full sailor rig. It
was a very good fit, and very becoming to our
hero, who was a remarkably handsome boy.</p>

<p>"A good fit, is it not?" asked the mate.</p>

<p>"Excellent," said Charlie.</p>

<p>"One would almost think the clothes were
meant for you," said Randall, with a smile,
which Charlie did not understand.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>X.<br /> <small>CHARLIE IN A TIGHT PLACE.</small></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlie</span> surveyed himself in his new attire
with some complacency. He felt that it was
becoming, and it gave him a new feeling of
manliness. In fact it seemed to him, for the
time being, as if he were really a sailor.
Charlie, however, though he was very well
pleased with his sailor's rig, did not feel in
the least tempted to wear it professionally.
Accordingly, after the survey was over, he
began to divest himself of it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>"What are you doing?" asked the mate,
laying his hand heavily upon the shoulder of
our young hero.</p>

<p>"Taking off your nephew's clothes," returned
Charlie, looking up in considerable
surprise at the tone in which he was addressed.</p>

<p>"What's that for?"</p>

<p>"To put on my own."</p>

<p>"Then you needn't trouble yourself," said
Randall, composedly; "those you have on are
your own."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" asked Charlie
meeting the mate's triumphant look with an
open, manly glance.</p>

<p>"I mean," said Randall, with a sardonic
look, "that the clothes were bought for the
one who now wears them."</p>

<p>"Bought for me!" exclaimed Charlie, in
great bewilderment.</p>

<p>"Yes. You wondered how they happened
to fit you so well. That is easily
explained. They were picked out on purpose
for you. The old Jew in the clothing-store
took your measure with his eye while you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
were standing there with me. Faith, he's got
a pretty sharp eye."</p>

<p>"But your nephew?" said Charlie, his
heart sinking, as he began to comprehend
the plot to which he had fallen a victim;
"I thought you said they belonged to
him."</p>

<p>"Well," said Randall, with a harsh laugh,
"you're my nephew."</p>

<p>"I am not," said Charlie, with something
of haughtiness in his tone, as he surveyed the
mate scornfully.</p>

<p>"He's got his mother's look," muttered
the latter. "That's the way she looked when
she sent me about my business. She'd look
something different, I fancy, if she knew I'd
got her boy in my power. I've got the whip-hand
of her now, and she'll live yet to repent
the day she rejected Jack Randall."</p>

<p>These thoughts flashed through his mind
in an instant, and did not prevent his answering
at once Charlie's bold denial.</p>

<p>"There's a little too much pride about you,
youngster. It'll need taming down. You're
to be my nephew while you're aboard this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
ship. Remember, your name is Jack Randall.
Take care that you claim no other."</p>

<p>"What good will that do?" said Charlie.
"I am not going to remain on board."</p>

<p>"You're not, eh?" said the mate, significantly.</p>

<p>"No," said Charlie, boldly.</p>

<p>"Suppose I say you shall."</p>

<p>"Then," said Charlie, firmly, "I say you are
mistaken."</p>

<p>Our hero was a boy of spirit, and had no
idea of being disposed of without his own
consent. He commenced tugging away at his
blue jacket with the intention of pulling it
off.</p>

<p>"What are you doing?" asked Randall,
with a frown, advancing and laying a heavy
hand on the boy's shoulder. "Haven't I told
you to keep those clothes on?"</p>

<p>"You have no right to interfere with me,"
said Charlie, stoutly, his eye flashing with indignation.
"Give me back my clothes."</p>

<p>"You can't have them. If you strip off
those you have on you'll have to go without
any."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p>Exasperated, Charlie made a spring forward,
and attempted to wrest his clothes from
the hands of the mate.</p>

<p>"Ha, my fine fellow!" exclaimed Randall,
as, evading the boy's grasp, he lifted them
beyond his reach. "So you are inclined to
be mutinous, are you? Very well, we have
a remedy for all such cases, and a very simple
one it is."</p>

<p>So saying, he drew a stout cord from his
pocket, and advanced towards our hero with
the intention of binding him.</p>

<p>Charlie sprang for the stairs, and was half
way up before the mate caught him and
dragged him back.</p>

<p>"Well, boy, you're a pretty tough customer&mdash;true
grit. You're just the boy to make a
sailor of. I must make sure of you."</p>

<p>So saying, he succeeded, in spite of Charlie's
vigorous exertions, in tying his hands and
feet. Not until thus rendered quite helpless
did the brave boy suffer himself to burst into
tears.</p>

<p>"What are you going to do with me?" he
asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>"I am going to make a sailor of you," answered
the mate.</p>

<p>"But I don't want to go to sea," answered
Charlie.</p>

<p>"So you said once before, but you'll change
your mind before long."</p>

<p>"My mother will not know where I am.
She can't get along without me, for she depends
upon me in part for support."</p>

<p>"I dare say she'll get along somehow," said
Randall, coolly. "She won't miss you much,
and she ought to feel glad that your uncle
has taken charge of you."</p>

<p>"Uncle!" retorted the boy, with flashing
eyes. "I wouldn't own you as uncle for all
the money in Boston."</p>

<p>"You wouldn't!" said Randall, his tone
changing, and a dark look overspreading his
face. "Very well, my bold lad, you may
have reason to repent those words. You may
find out by and by that it is as well to be civil
to your superior officer. I will do nothing
about it now, but when we are out of port
and fairly at sea, look out!"</p>

<p>Charlie, who was quick-witted, caught a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
hint from these words, and at once set up a
scream, hoping to draw attention from outside.</p>

<p>"That's your game, is it?" said the mate.
"We'll soon stop that."</p>

<p>So saying, he drew out the boy's own handkerchief,
and gagged him so that there was
no further fear of his being able to make any
disturbance which could be heard on the
wharf or on neighboring vessels.</p>

<p>Feeling now secure, he left Charlie mute
and helpless, and ascended to the deck.</p>

<p>"What was the noise I heard below, Mr.
Randall?" asked the captain, pausing in his
walk, and addressing his first officer.</p>

<p>"My nephew!" said Randall, with a smile.</p>

<p>"Ha! he is a little obstreperous, is he?"</p>

<p>"A trifle so."</p>

<p>"Doesn't like the society of his uncle sufficiently
to want to go to sea with him, I
suppose?"</p>

<p>"I dare say he would like to change his
quarters," said Randall, composedly.</p>

<p>"How did you reconcile him to his fate?"</p>

<p>"A couple of strong cords and a gag did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
the business. They will keep him quiet till
we get out to sea, and then perhaps we can
discover some other means of bringing him to
terms."</p>

<p>"A slightly different application of the
cords, perhaps, Mr. Randall."</p>

<p>The mate smiled approval of this jest, and
as his services were now in requisition to expedite
preparations for departure, he left the
captain and went about his duty.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the mate's conduct had not been
unobserved by the crew. Among these was
an old sailor who rejoiced in the name of
Bill Sturdy. It is needless to say that this
was not his real name. No one appeared to
know what his real name was, and he had
become so used to this, that he generally
called himself so. The name Sturdy had
probably been given him on account of his
sturdy make. He was stout and very powerful.
Probably there were no two men on
board the ship who would not have felt some
hesitation in attacking Bill Sturdy.</p>

<p>It may be added that the name was no less
appropriate if we consider it bestowed on account<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
of his character and disposition. He
was unpolished enough, having beaten about
the world all his life, yet he had been gifted
by nature with a fund of sturdy common
sense and powers of observation which made
him more thoughtful and intelligent than
most of his class. He had a kind heart, and
hated to see oppression. This was his first
voyage on board the Bouncing Betsey; the
ship on which he had last served having been
wrecked, and he with a few others having,
with difficulty, saved themselves. Since he
had engaged on board the Betsey, the stories
he had heard of the captain's brutality led
him to repent of his determination, and he
had resolved within himself to remain on
board but a single voyage.</p>

<p>He had had his attention drawn to our
hero and the mate, and he observed that the
latter came up alone from below.</p>

<p>"That's a trim, handsome little lad," he
said to himself; "I wonder what the mate is
so attentive to him for. There's some deviltry
in the wind, as sure as my name is Bill
Sturdy. I hope, for the boy's sake, he isn't<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
going to ship with us. If he does. I must do
what I can for him, for I mistrust he'll want
a friend."</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>XI.<br /> <small>OFF TO SEA.</small></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> thoughts of our young hero as he lay
helpless, gagged and bound, were hardly of
the most cheerful character. The blow had
been so sudden, that he was quite unprepared
for it. Added to this, his apprehensions were
vague and indefinite. There seemed something
mysterious about the manner in which
he had been spirited away, and this thought
increased his feeling of discomfort. A danger
which can be measured and comprehended in
its full extent may be boldly faced, however
great, but when we are ignorant of its nature
and extent that is not so easy.</p>

<p>Charlie understood as much as this, that it
was the intention of Randall to carry him off
to sea. But why he should have taken such
pains to ensnare him, when there are always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
plenty of boys glad to obtain such a situation,
he could not conceive.</p>

<p>Charlie was no coward. He was no stranger
to the bold spirit of adventure by which boys
of his age are apt to be animated. Indeed,
under different circumstances, and if the arrangement
had been of his own free choice,
it is quite possible that he might have looked
forward with pleasurable anticipations to the
life that awaited him. But there was one
thought uppermost in his mind that gave him
no little pain and anxiety, the thought of his
mother. He was her all. In the large and
busy city she knew but very few; she had
none whom she could call friends. Her hopes
were all centred in him. Still farther, it was
in a great measure owing to his activity and
industry that she had been able to live with
a degree of comfort, for though she was always
at work, the avenues of industry open
to women are few, and toil at the needle is
so unsatisfactorily compensated that Charlie,
though working fewer hours, was able to
contribute considerably more than half of the
sum required for their joint support.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p>How would his mother get along during
his absence, the length of which he could not
estimate? Would she suffer not only in mind
but in bodily discomfort? Well he remembered
how pleasantly the evenings had passed
when they were together. Now there must
be a long separation. Would he ever see his
mother again? She would not be able to retain
their present lodging, now that the entire
rent would fall to her to pay. Perhaps when
he did he should be unable to obtain any
clew to her whereabouts. This was indeed a
terrible thought to poor Charlie, who chafed
like a caged lion in his confinement. He endeavored
to unloose the cords which bound
him, but with little prospect of success; for
no one better than a sailor understands the art
of tying a knot securely.</p>

<p>While Charlie was doing his utmost to free
himself from the cords that bound him, having
already removed the gag, he was startled
by a low laugh of triumphant malice.</p>

<p>Looking up, he saw the mate, the author
of all his misfortunes, watching him with
great apparent enjoyment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ah, Jack," he said, "I see you are hard
at work. Work away. If you untie those
knots you've got more skilful fingers than
the one that tied them, that's all."</p>

<p>"Come and release me," said Charlie. "You
have no right to keep me here."</p>

<p>"You are mistaken," said the mate, coolly.
"I have the best of all rights."</p>

<p>"And what right is that?" demanded our
hero.</p>

<p>"<i>The right of power!</i>" answered Randall.
"Might makes right, perhaps you have heard."</p>

<p>"How long are you going to keep me
here?" asked Charlie, after a pause.</p>

<p>"Till we get far enough out to sea to make
it safe to release you."</p>

<p>Charlie kept silence. He felt that it would
be useless to appeal to the mercy of the mate,
who appeared bent upon carrying him away.
He turned his face resolutely away from Randall,
for whom he began to entertain a
stronger feeling of dislike than he had supposed
himself capable of feeling. Hitherto
he had only been accustomed to an atmosphere
of affection, and though he had met<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
with some rebuffs in his daily search for employment,
he could always return at night to
a home and a mother, with whom he could
forget whatever had been disagreeable during
the day. Now his position was entirely
changed. The only one he knew on board
the vessel was one whom he had no reason to
believe friendly, but very much the reverse.</p>

<p>By this time the noise upon deck, which
he could hear plainly, had become greater and
greater. He could hear frequent orders given
by the captain, and also by the mate, who
had now returned to his post.</p>

<p>Soon the vessel, which had been at rest, appeared
to be moving. He could hear the
plashing of the water against its sides. He
felt that it was in motion, slow at first, but
afterwards more rapid. He conjectured that
the ship was being towed out to sea by a
steam-tug.</p>

<p>He wished that at least he could get to a
window, and catch a last glimpse of the land
to which he was about to bid so unexpected
a farewell. But this, tied hand and foot as he
was, was impossible, and he felt that now it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
would do him no good even if he should succeed
in breaking his bonds. Already they
were speeding out to sea as fast as the tug
could convey them. There was no redress or
help for him beyond the limits of the vessel
in which his tyrants exercised absolute control,
for he felt well assured that Captain
Brace was in league with the mate, or, at all
events, would interpose his authority to support
Randall in his plans.</p>

<p>So time sped on, the ship continuing all
the while in steady motion.</p>

<p>At length the tug left them and returned
to the city, leaving the vessel to shift for
itself. Although Charlie could not see what
was going on, he judged this from the noise
and shouts of command given above, to which
he listened with sharpened attention.</p>

<p>Charlie felt that with the departure of the
steam-tug all possibility of escape had passed.
The last link which had bound him to the
shore had been snapped asunder.</p>

<p>While he was plunged in sorrowful thought
he suddenly heard a step descending the
stairs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>

<p>Thinking it was the mate, of whom he felt
that he should see in future much more than
he cared, he did not turn his head.</p>

<p>"Hallo, my lad," was the salutation of the
new-comer, in a rough, but hearty voice, "how
came you in this trim?"</p>

<p>It was not the mate's harsh voice. Quickly
turning round, Charlie's eyes rested on the
bronzed but good-humored face of Bill Sturdy,
the stout sailor to whom reference has already
been made. Whatever may be thought
of physiognomy as an index of character, it
is undeniable that we are either attracted to
or repelled from certain faces.</p>

<p>Now the first sight of Bill Sturdy's honest
and good-humored face seemed to Charlie like
a ray of light in a dark place. He felt that
he was a man to be trusted.</p>

<p>"Will you be a friend to me?" asked
Charlie, with instinctive confidence.</p>

<p>"That I will, my lad," exclaimed Bill, with
hearty emphasis; "but tell me who tied you
up in this fashion?"</p>

<p>"His name is Randall, and I believe he is
the mate."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>"The lubberly rascal! And what did he
do that for?"</p>

<p>"He entrapped me on board the vessel, and
now he is carrying me out to sea, against my
will."</p>

<p>"How came you in your sailor's rig?"
asked Sturdy.</p>

<p>Charlie explained the trick which had been
practised upon him, which Bill Sturdy denounced
in good set terms, though possibly
more strong than refined.</p>

<p>"He's a rascal; there ain't a doubt of that,"
said Bill. "I should like to overhaul him,
and teach him better manners. As for you,
my lad, I'm sorry for you. You've shipped
for the v'y'ge, and there ain't any help for it,
as I see. But you may depend upon one
thing, old Bill Sturdy will look out for you,
and will be your friend."</p>

<p>"Thank you," said our hero, feeling more
cheerful and hopeful. It was something to
have one friend on board.</p>

<p>"I mistrust there are some rascals aboard,"
muttered Bill to himself, as he went up on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
deck. "They'd better not interfere with me
or that young lad!" and he extended his
muscular arm with a sense of power.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>XII.<br /> <small>LANDLORD AND TENANT.</small></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> payment of a thousand dollars to Randall
had been a severe blow to old Peter
Manson, and this consideration materially
lessened the satisfaction which he felt in
Charlie's removal.</p>

<p>We re-introduce him to our readers, engaged,
as usual, in counting over his hoards.
Preparatory to doing so, he carefully secured
the outer door, and also the door of the apartment
which he occupied.</p>

<p>Then lifting up a plank from the floor, he
raised from beneath a large box containing
gold coins. It was very heavy, and it was
not without difficulty that the old man, who
was very feeble, succeeded in lifting it to a
level with the floor.</p>

<p>The box was, perhaps, four fifths full.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>

<p>The old man surveyed the deficiency with
a groan.</p>

<p>"It might have been full," he muttered, "if
I hadn't been obliged to pay away such a sight
of money to that determined man. One thousand
dollars! two hundred bright, sparkling
coins! How many, many weary days it will
take before I can supply their place. It was
all but full. It wanted only ten more coins
to make five thousand dollars. Oh gold, gold,
gold! How beautiful you are! To me you
are food and drink and clothing and friends
and relations. I care for nothing but you."</p>

<p>While Peter was indulging in this soliloquy,
he was engaged in counting the coins in the
box.</p>

<p>The result of the count showed one less
than he had anticipated.</p>

<p>The old man turned pale.</p>

<p>"Some one has robbed me," he muttered.
"Or, perchance, I have counted wrong. I
will go over it again."</p>

<p>This he did with eager haste and a feeling
of nervous anxiety, and, to his no small dismay,
the count resulted as before.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<p>"They have taken my money!" exclaimed
Peter, tearing his white hair in anguish.
"They will make me a beggar, and I shall be
reduced to want in my old age. Oh, oh!"</p>

<p>In the midst of his lamentations he suddenly
discovered the missing coin, which had
rolled away, without his observing it, to the
opposite side of the room.</p>

<p>Chuckling with delight, he picked it up
and replaced it in the box.</p>

<p>His duty satisfactorily performed, the miser
put on his cloak, and prepared for another
task. This was, to raise Mrs. Codman's rent,
and so compel her to leave the rooms which
she rented of him. This, however, was unnecessary,
since, deprived of Charlie's earnings,
his mother would have found it impossible
to pay the rent previously demanded.</p>

<p>Peter Manson resolved to call upon his
tenant in person. He was not afraid of
recognition. He felt that the changes which
twenty years had wrought in his appearance,
would be a sufficient protection. Indeed,
this had already been tested; for Peter had
already called several times on the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
errand, without attracting a glance which
could be construed into recognition.</p>

<p>It was the morning after Charlie had disappeared.
He had been absent twenty-four
hours, and his mother had heard nothing of
him. She was in a terrible state of apprehension
and anxiety, for few boys were more
regular than he in repairing home as soon as
his daily duties were over.</p>

<p>Mrs. Codman had sat up late into the night,
hoping against her fears that he would return.
At length, exhausted by her vigils, she sank
upon the bed, but not to sleep. In the morning
she rose, unrefreshed, to prepare her
solitary meal. But it was in vain. Sorrow
and anxiety had taken away her appetite,
and she was unable to eat anything.</p>

<p>Soon afterwards a knock was heard at the
door. She hastened to open it, hoping to
hear some tidings of her lost boy. What was
her disappointment to meet the bent form
and wrinkled face of Peter Manson, her landlord.</p>

<p>The old man gave her a stealthy glance.</p>

<p>"Why did I not know her before?" he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
thought. "She is not so very much changed.
But I&mdash;ha, ha! she don't know who I am."</p>

<p>Mrs. Codman went to a drawer in her
bureau, and took therefrom six dollars.</p>

<p>"This is the amount of your rent, I believe,"
she said.</p>

<p>The old man greedily closed his fingers
upon the money, and then, after intimating
that it was very small, avowed his determination
to raise the rent to two dollars per
week.</p>

<p>The miser watched with gleeful exultation
the look of dismay which came over the
face of his tenant.</p>

<p>Two dollars a week was not only beyond
Mrs. Codman's means, but was, at that time,
an exorbitant rent for the rooms which she
occupied. She would scarcely have been
justified in paying it while she had Charlie's
earnings as well as her own to depend on.
Yet there seemed now an imperative necessity
for remaining where she was, for a time at
least. It was possible that Charlie would
come back, and if she should remove, where
would he find her? Of course, he would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
come back! The thought that there was
even a possibility of her son being lost to her
was so full of shuddering terror, that Mrs.
Codman would not for a moment indulge
it. Life without Charlie would be so full
of sadness, that she could not believe him
lost.</p>

<p>She resolved to make an effort to arouse
the old man's compassion. She did not dream
of the spite and hatred which he felt towards
her. There are none whom the wicked hate
so heartily as those whom they have injured.
That is something beyond forgiveness.</p>

<p>Mrs. Codman knew that Peter Manson was
avaricious, and to this she attributed the increase
in the rent. She had no suspicion
that he had a particular object in distressing
her.</p>

<p>"Surely, Mr. Manson," she remonstrated,
"You do not think these rooms worth two
dollars a week. It is all we are able to do to
raise the rent we now pay."</p>

<p>"Humph!" muttered Peter, avoiding the
eye of his tenant, "they are worth all I can
get for them."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p>"Have you raised the rent on the other
rooms in this house?"</p>

<p>"No, but I&mdash;I shall soon."</p>

<p>"Then I tremble for your tenants. Mr.
Manson, if you were poor yourself, perhaps
you would have a heart to sympathize with
and pity the poor."</p>

<p>"If I were poor!" exclaimed the old man,
betrayed into his customary whine; "I am
poor; indeed, I am very poor."</p>

<p>"You!" repeated Mrs. Codman, incredulously.
"Why, you must receive a thousand
dollars a year from this building."</p>

<p>"Yet I&mdash;I am poor," persisted Peter. "I
am only an agent. I&mdash;I do not own this
building; at least&mdash;I mean&mdash;there are heavy
incumbrances on it; I have to pay away
nearly every dollar I receive."</p>

<p>"Can you let me remain a month longer
for the same rent as heretofore?" asked Mrs.
Codman, anxiously.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I couldn't do it," said Peter, hastily.
"Either you must pay two dollars a week, or
move out."</p>

<p>Mrs. Codman hesitated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>

<p>She went to her bureau, and found that
she had between five and six dollars remaining
in her purse. This would enable her, in
addition to what she could earn by sewing, to
get along for a month.</p>

<p>"Very well, sir," said she, "I must stay a
month longer, at any rate. I must for my
boy's sake."</p>

<p>"Have you a son?" asked Peter, desirous
of learning from the mother's lips that the
blow had struck home.</p>

<p>"Yes; you have probably seen him here
sometimes."</p>

<p>"I haven't noticed him."</p>

<p>"I am feeling very anxious about him.
Yesterday morning he went out on an errand
for some one who had engaged him, and he
hasn't been back since. I am afraid something
must have happened to him," and the
mother's eyes filled with tears.</p>

<p>"Perhaps he has fallen off from one of the
wharves, and got drowned," suggested Peter,
with a savage delight in the pain he was inflicting.</p>

<p>"You don't think it possible!" exclaimed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
Mrs. Codman, starting to her feet, and looking
in the old man's face with a glance of agonized
entreaty, as if he could change by his words
the fate of her son.</p>

<p>"Such things often happen," said Peter,
chuckling inwardly at the success of his remark;
"I knew a boy&mdash;an Irish boy, about
the size of yours&mdash;drowned the other day."</p>

<p>"About the size of my boy! I thought
you had not noticed him."</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I remember having seen him once,"
stammered Peter. "He is about a dozen
years old, isn't he?"</p>

<p>"Yes; but you don't&mdash;you can't think him
drowned."</p>

<p>"How should I know?" muttered Peter.
"Boys are careless, very careless, you know
that; and like as not he might have been
playing on the wharf, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, it can't be," said Mrs. Codman, with
a feeling of relief which her knowledge of
Charlie's habits gave her. "Charlie was not
careless, and never went to play on the
wharf."</p>

<p>The old man was disappointed to find that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
his blow had failed of its effect, but ingenious
in devising new methods of torture, he now
suggested the true cause of Charlie's absence.</p>

<p>"Perhaps," he said, with his cruel gray
eyes fixed upon the mother, "perhaps he's
been carried off in a ship."</p>

<p>"Carried off in a ship!" faltered Mrs.
Codman.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Peter, delighted by the evident
dismay with which this suggestion was received.</p>

<p>"But," said Mrs. Codman, not quite comprehending
his meaning, "Charlie never had
any inclination to go to sea."</p>

<p>"Perhaps they didn't consult him about it,"
suggested Peter.</p>

<p>"<i>What do you mean?</i>" exclaimed the
mother, with startling emphasis, half advancing
towards the old man.</p>

<p>"You&mdash;you shouldn't be so violent," said
Peter, trembling, and starting back in alarm.</p>

<p>"Violent! Deprive a mother of her only
child, and she may well show some vehemence."</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I didn't do it," said Peter, hastily.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>

<p>"Certainly not," said Mrs. Codman, wondering
at his thinking it necessary to exculpate
himself; "but you were saying something
about&mdash;about boys being carried to sea against
their will."</p>

<p>"I didn't mean anything," muttered Peter,
regretting that he had put her on the right
track.</p>

<p>"But you did, otherwise you would not
have said it. For heaven's sake, tell me what
you did mean, and all you meant. Don't fear
to distress me. I can bear anything except
this utter uncertainty."</p>

<p>She looked up earnestly in the old man's
face.</p>

<p>Peter was somewhat amused at the idea
that he might be afraid to distress her, but
decided, on reflection, to tell her that all he
chose she should be made acquainted with.</p>

<p>"Sometimes," he explained, "a captain is
short of hands, and fills out his number the
best way he can. Now perhaps one of the
ships at the wharves might have wanted a
boy, and the captain might have invited your
son on board, and, ha, ha! it almost makes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
me laugh to think of it, might carry him off
before he thought where he was."</p>

<p>"Do you laugh at the thought of such a
cruel misfortune?" asked Mrs. Codman,
startled from her grief by the old man's
chuckle.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;excuse me, I didn't intend to; but I
thought he would be so much surprised when
he found out where he was."</p>

<p>"And does that seem to you a fitting subject
for merriment?" demanded the outraged
mother.</p>

<p>The miser cowed beneath her indignant
glance, and muttering something unintelligible,
slunk away.</p>

<p>"Curse her!" he muttered, in his quavering
tones, "why can't I face her like a man?
I never could. That was the way when&mdash;when
she rejected me. But I shall have my
revenge yet."</p>

<p>Strange to say, Peter's last suggestion
produced an effect quite different from that
which he anticipated and intended. Days
passed, and Charlie did not come; but his
mother feeling certain, she hardly knew why,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
that he had been inveigled on board some
vessel, felt sure he would some day return.</p>

<p>"He will write to me as soon as he gets a
chance," thought the mother, "and I shall
soon see him again."</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>XIII.<br /> <small>CLOUDS AND SUNSHINE.</small></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Small</span> as was the remuneration which Mrs.
Codman received for sewing, she hoped, by
great economy, to get along with the money
which she already had on hand. But troubles
never come singly, and of this she was destined
to feel the full significance.</p>

<p>One morning she made up a bundle of
completed work, and proceeded with it to the
ready-made clothing store of Messrs. Sharp &amp;
Keene, her employers. It was a trial to one
reared as Mrs. Codman had been, to come into
contact with men who did not think it necessary
to hide their native coarseness from one
who made shirts for them at twenty cents
apiece.</p>

<p>On the present occasion she was kept<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
waiting for some time, before her presence
appeared to be noticed. At length, Sharp
nodded to her from the desk.</p>

<p>"Ahem! Mrs. Wiggins," commenced
Sharp.</p>

<p>"Codman, sir," corrected the one addressed.</p>

<p>"Well, the name don't signify, I suppose.
How many shirts have you got there?"</p>

<p>"Half a dozen, sir."</p>

<p>"Half a dozen at twenty cents apiece make
a dollar and twenty cents. Present this card
at the other desk, and you will be paid."</p>

<p>He scratched on a card "6 shirts&mdash;$1.20,"
and handed to her, at the same time calling,
in a loud voice, "Here, Thomas, pay Mrs.
Wigman a dollar and twenty cents."</p>

<p>"Codman, sir."</p>

<p>"It seems to me you are mighty particular
about your name."</p>

<p>"Shall I have more work?" asked Mrs.
Codman, with some anxiety.</p>

<p>"Well, not at present. Business is dull
just now. Nothing doing, and won't be for
some time to come."</p>

<p>"How long before you can probably give<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
me something to do?" inquired Mrs. Codman,
apprehensively.</p>

<p>"Can't say," was the careless reply. "It
may be a month, or six weeks. You can call
round in four or five weeks."</p>

<p>"What am I to do between now and
then?" thought the poor woman, her heart
sinking.</p>

<p>She must get something to do. She could
not live otherwise, more especially since the
rise in the rent, and her resources had been
so largely diminished by the withdrawal of
Charlie's services.</p>

<p>She applied at several other shops which
she passed on the way home, but found, in
every case, that they were already overrun
with applications, and in the slack of business
would be compelled to discharge some of
those at present employed.</p>

<p>But the hour is the darkest that's just
before day, and when fortune has done its
worst, oftentimes the tide turns, and affairs
improve.</p>

<p>So it proved with Mrs. Codman.</p>

<p>On reaching home, not a little depressed at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
the idea of remaining inactive, when she stood
so much in need of the proceeds of her labor,
Mrs. Codman had scarcely removed her bonnet
and shawl, when she heard a knock at her
door.</p>

<p>In answer to her "Come in," the door
opened, and the washer-woman, who roomed
just above, entered.</p>

<p>"How do you do, Mrs. O'Grady?" said
Mrs. Codman.</p>

<p>"I am very well, <i>Miss</i> Codman, and I hope
it's the same wid yerself. Have you heard
anything of the swate boy that was lost?"</p>

<p>"Nothing," was the sad reply.</p>

<p>"Cheer up, then, <i>Miss</i> Codman. He'll be
coming back bimeby, wid his pockets full of
gold, so that you won't have to work any
more."</p>

<p>"I am afraid that I shall not be able to
work any more at present," returned Mrs.
Codman.</p>

<p>"And what for not? Is it sick that ye
are?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Codman related the want of success
which she had met with in procuring work.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
She also mentioned Peter's visit and the increased
rent.</p>

<p>"Just like him, the old spalpeen!" broke
out Mrs. O'Grady, indignantly. "He wants
to squeeze the last cint out of us poor folks,
and it don't do him any good neither. I'd be
ashamed if Mr. O'Grady wint about dressed
as he does. But may be, Miss Codman, I'll
get you a chance that'll take you out of his
reach, the mane ould rascal!"</p>

<p>"You get me a chance! What do you
mean?" asked Mrs. Codman, turning with
surprise to her Hibernian friend and defender.</p>

<p>"I'll tell ye, only jist sit down, for it may
take me some time."</p>

<p>This was Mrs. O'Grady's explanation, which
it may be better to abridge, for the good lady
was wont to be somewhat prolix and discursive
in her narratives.</p>

<p>It seems she had been employed, at sundry
times, in the house of a Mr. Bowman, a
wealthy merchant living on Mt. Vernon
Street. This gentleman had lost his wife
some months before. The only child arising<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
from this union was a daughter, about ten
years of age. Her father did not like schools,
either public or private, for a child of her
years, and preferred that his daughter, for the
present, should be educated at home. Hitherto
she had been left pretty much to herself, and
had never been willing to apply herself to
study.</p>

<p>Mr. Bowman was now looking out for a
suitable governess for his daughter, and it had
struck Mrs. O'Grady&mdash;who, though ignorant
and uncultivated herself, was sharp-sighted
enough to detect the marks of education and
refinement in another&mdash;that Mrs. Codman
would suit him.</p>

<p>So Mrs. O'Grady, in her zeal, made bold to
intimate to the servants, through whom it
reached Mr. Bowman, that she knew a sweet
lady who would be just the one for a governess
for the young lady.</p>

<p>Now the recommendation of an Irish
washer-woman may not be considered the
most valuable in an affair of this kind; but it
so happened that the suggestion reached Mr.
Bowman at a time when he was so oppressed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
with business cares that he did not know how
to spare the time necessary to seek out a
governess. He accordingly summoned Mrs.
O'Grady to a conference, and asked some
hasty questions of her, which she answered by
such a eulogistic account of Mrs. Codman,
whose condescending kindness had quite won
her heart, that Mr. Bowman desired her to
request Mrs. Codman to call upon him the
next day at a stated hour.</p>

<p>"So you see, Miss Codman," concluded the
warmhearted Irish woman, "that you're in
luck, and all you've got to do is to call upon
Mr. Bowman to-morrow, and you'll get a nice
home, and won't have to work any more at
your sewing."</p>

<p>Mrs. Codman did not at once reply.</p>

<p>"And won't you go?" asked Mrs. O'Grady,
wondering at her silence.</p>

<p>"I think I will," said Mrs. Codman; "and
I feel much obliged to you, my good friend,
for saying a kind word for me, though I do
not feel at all confident that I shall obtain this
place."</p>

<p>"Niver fear for that," said the sanguine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
washer-woman; "he'll see at once that you're
a rale lady, and it's in luck he'll be to get
you."</p>

<p>Undoubtedly the position of a governess
would be more remunerative, and less laborious,
than that of a seamstress, and, under
present circumstances, Mrs. Codman felt that
she could not afford to throw the chance
away. She retired that night a little more
cheerful and hopeful than would have been
the case had not this door of escape from the
evil of want been shown her.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>XIV.<br /> <small>BERT.</small></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the breakfast-room of a house on Mt.
Vernon Street sat two persons with whom
it is necessary that we should become
acquainted.</p>

<p>The first is a gentleman of perhaps forty-five,
rather stout, and with a pleasant expression
of countenance. He has finished his cup
of coffee, and taken up the morning paper,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
which he scans carefully, more especially
those parts relating to business.</p>

<p>At the opposite side of the table is a young
lady of ten, with mirthful black eyes, and
very red cheeks, which are well set off by her
black hair. Altogether, she is very handsome,
a fact of which she is not altogether unconscious.
She is lively, fresh, original, and
impulsive, not under very much restraint, but
with an excellent disposition and kindly feelings,
which do not allow her to go very far
wrong. Yet it must be confessed that thus
far her education has been sadly neglected,
so that, as far as learning goes, she probably
knows less than most girls two years
younger.</p>

<p>The room, in which the father and daughter
were seated, is tastefully furnished with that
regard to comfort which is found in our
American houses.</p>

<p>The two whom we have thus introduced
are Benjamin Bowman, a wealthy merchant,
and his daughter Bertha, though, in that
shortening of names which is apt to take place
in a family, hers has been shortened to Bert,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
which she appears to prefer to the longer and
more strictly feminine name.</p>

<p>"Papa," she said, pushing away her plate,
"you ain't good company at all."</p>

<p>"Thank you for the compliment, Bert," he
said.</p>

<p>"But you're not, though. There you are
wearing out your eyes over that stupid paper,
and leaving me to talk to myself or Topsy.
Here, Topsy, isn't it so?"</p>

<p>At this summons a kitten, black as the ace
of spades, and very much addicted to fun and
frolic, jumped into the lap of her young mistress,
and purred a noisy acquiescence.</p>

<p>"There," said Bert, triumphantly, "Topsy
says I am right. I don't know what I should
do without Topsy."</p>

<p>"She makes a very suitable companion for
you, Bert," said Mr. Bowman, smiling.</p>

<p>"Why?" asked the cat's mistress, suspiciously.</p>

<p>"Because you can sympathize so well.
Both are equally mischievous, and it is very
difficult to tell which knows the most of
books."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p>"Now, papa, that is a slander. I will sue
you for libel."</p>

<p>"On your own account, or the kitten's?"
asked Mr. Bowman. "I really don't know
which I have done injustice to."</p>

<p>"Now you are laughing at me, papa. I
know you are."</p>

<p>"Not entirely, Bert. The fact is, you are
terribly ignorant for one of your age."</p>

<p>"I suppose I am," said Bert, shaking her
head in comic despair.</p>

<p>"You'll grow up with no more knowledge
than a Hottentot."</p>

<p>"Don't they have any schools among the
Hottentots?"</p>

<p>"I suppose not."</p>

<p>"How delightful that must be! Why
can't we move out where they live?"</p>

<p>"I don't know but we shall have to," said
her father, "as, hereabouts, young ladies are
expected to know something about books.
But that reminds me I don't know but I
shall succeed in engaging a governess for you
to-day."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<p>"A governess to-day!" exclaimed Bert, in
dismay.</p>

<p>"Yes. I have made an appointment with
a lady to call here at nine o'clock, and, if I
am satisfied with her, I intend to engage
her."</p>

<p>"And if <i>I</i> am satisfied with her," added
Bert.</p>

<p>"Is that essential?" asked her father, smiling.</p>

<p>"Yes, for you know she will be with me
most of the time. If she is like Julia Campbell's
governess, I sha'n't like her."</p>

<p>"Well, and what fault do you find with
Julia Campbell's governess?" asked Mr.
Bowman, with more interest than his tone
conveyed; for he knew that if Bert did not
fancy her governess she would be a most incorrigible
little rebel, and would be likely to
profit very little by her instructions.</p>

<p>"Oh, she's as disagreeable as she can be.
In the first place, she's an old maid,&mdash;not
that that's so <i>very</i> bad. In fact, I've about
made up my mind to be an old maid
myself."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>

<p>"Indeed!" said Mr. Bowman, amused.
"May I inquire your reasons?"</p>

<p>"Too numerous to mention."</p>

<p>"Perhaps one is, that you don't expect to
have any chance to change your name."</p>

<p>"I have had a chance already," said Bert,
in a matter-of-fact tone.</p>

<p>"Had a chance already!" exclaimed her
father, in amazement.</p>

<p>"Yes," said the young lady of ten, "Charlie
Morrill offered himself the other day, and I
refused him."</p>

<p>"What is the world coming to?" thought
Mr. Bowman. "Why did you refuse him?"</p>

<p>"Because," said Bert, soberly, "I don't like
the way he parts his hair. But as for Julia's
governess, I know she never had an offer.
She's as homely as&mdash;as&mdash;well, I don't know
who. Then she wears glasses, and has a nose
ever so long, and a long face, and she never
smiles, and she makes Julia study terrible
hard."</p>

<p>And Bert drew a long breath.</p>

<p>"Not a very charming picture, certainly,"
said Mr. Bowman; "but I'll promise you that,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
if the lady who applies for the post of governess
to-day should be anything like this, I
won't engage her."</p>

<p>"That's right, papa. When do you expect
her?"</p>

<p>"Let me see. She was to be here at nine,
and now it wants only ten minutes of that
time."</p>

<p>"And you won't send me out of the room,
papa, will you?"</p>

<p>Mr. Bowman hesitated.</p>

<p>"You know I am very anxious to see
how she looks. If I like her, I will make
a sign to you, and then you can engage
her."</p>

<p>"What sign will you make, Bert?" asked
her father, amused, and yet alive to the necessity
of securing his daughter's acquiescence
in his choice.</p>

<p>"I don't know," said Bert, reflecting;
"suppose I wink."</p>

<p>"And suppose the lady should see you
winking at me? What do you suppose she
would think?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I could tell her afterwards, you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
know, and she would feel flattered, knowing
it was a sign that I liked her."</p>

<p>"She might not think it very lady-like in
you."</p>

<p>"What's the use of being lady-like? I
don't want to be. There's Florence Gates;
I suppose she's lady-like. I'll show you how
she walks."</p>

<p>Bert imitated the gait of the young lady,
swaying herself from side to side, as she
walked with mincing step, tossing her head,
and exhibiting a caricature of the airs and
affectations which girls sometimes delight to
display.</p>

<p>"Why, she wouldn't run for a thousand
dollars," exclaimed Bert. "She would think
it beneath her dignity. If <i>she</i> is lady-like, I
don't want to be. But, hark! there goes the
bell. She's coming. Now, papa, just remember,
I shall wink if I like her, and if I
don't I'll make up a face."</p>

<p>Bert transferred herself to an ottoman, and
took Topsy into her lap.</p>

<p>Both she and her father looked towards
the door with curiosity.</p>

<h2>XV.<br /> <small>MRS. CODMAN'S GOOD FORTUNE.</small></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Codman</span> had been carefully educated
at a large expense, and was versed in all the
accomplishments which are considered indispensable
in a young lady's education nowadays.
It was with no degree of hesitation
on this point, therefore, that she set out this
particular morning to present herself as an
applicant for the post of governess. Having
no influential friends, however, and not being
able to present references from a former employer
(this being her first essay in this line),
she feared that her application would be unsuccessful.
She could not but feel a considerable
degree of anxiety, for her circumstances
had become desperate, owing to the refusal
of her former employers to give her any more
sewing.</p>

<p>She dressed herself as neatly as her limited
wardrobe would admit, and with hearty good
wishes and many glowing predictions of success<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
from her humble friend, Mrs. O'Grady,
she set out.</p>

<p>Though some years past thirty, Mrs. Codman
so far retained the freshness of youth,
that she would hardly have been taken for
this age. As a girl she had been very beautiful,
and her womanhood did not belie her
early promise. Her attire, though not expensive,
was in good taste and characterized
by a lady-like simplicity.</p>

<p>Such was the applicant for the post of
governess, upon whom the curious eyes of
Bert and her father fell as she was ushered
into the breakfast-room by the servant, who
had received orders to do so. She entered
the room with the easy grace of a lady. Mr.
Bowman at once recognized her claim to be
considered such by deferentially rising, and
inviting her to be seated.</p>

<p>"If I mistake not," he said, politely, "you
are the lady who has been recommended to
me as possessing excellent qualifications for
the office of governess."</p>

<p>"Perhaps the recommendation was too
strong and decided," said Mrs. Codman,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
modestly. "I shall be glad, however, to be
considered an applicant for the position."</p>

<p>Here Mr. Bowman, who chanced to glance
at Bert, detected her executing a surprising
succession of winks, indicating the favorable
impression which had been made upon her
by the appearance of Mrs. Codman.</p>

<p>Already prepossessed in favor of the applicant,
this was an additional inducement to
engage her, as her success would depend, to
a very great extent, upon the young lady's
good-will.</p>

<p>"I suppose," he said, "you feel prepared to
teach the branches and accomplishments usually
included in the education of a young lady."</p>

<p>Mrs. Codman bowed.</p>

<p>"I ain't a young lady," interrupted Bert,
at this point, who thought she was in imminent
danger of becoming too learned.</p>

<p>"We hope you will be some time," said
Mr. Bowman.</p>

<p>In reply, Bert winked once more.</p>

<p>There was a piano in the room.</p>

<p>"Will you favor us with a specimen of
your playing?" asked Mr. Bowman.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>

<p>Mrs. Codman sat down to the piano and
played two pieces, one slow in movement, the
other rapid, showing a nice touch and easy
execution.</p>

<p>"Thank you," said Mr. Bowman. "I am
inclined to think that I shall be glad to avail
myself of your services. Should you be willing
to engage for three months at first, to see
how we are mutually pleased with each other?
The pupil I have to offer you is a little addicted
to mischief, and I don't know how you
may like her."</p>

<p>"I am quite willing to enter into such an
arrangement," said Mrs. Codman; "and in
reference to the last point, I am quite sure I
shall like my pupil. I begin to like her
already."</p>

<p>"Do you?" said Bert, with much satisfaction,
rising from the ottoman, and unceremoniously
dropping the black kitten, who turned
a somerset, and ran off shaking her head.</p>

<p>In answer, Mrs. Codman held out her hand
with a smile.</p>

<p>Bert hurried across the room, and placed
her own in it confidingly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>

<p>"I am so glad you do," said she. "You
won't make me study my eyes out, will you?"</p>

<p>"That would, indeed, be a pity," said Mrs.
Codman, looking at Bert's bright eyes, sparkling
with fun and mischief.</p>

<p>Mr. Bowman observed these signs of agreement
between Bert and her new governess
with pleasure, and hastened to say, "In regard
to business arrangements we will speak
by and by. I think I can promise that they
will be satisfactory to you."</p>

<p>It may be mentioned here, that Mr. Bowman,
who was by no means disposed to deal
parsimoniously with those in his employ,
fixed Mrs. Codman's salary at six hundred dollars
a year, which was four times as much as
she had ever been able to gain by her needle.</p>

<p>"When may we expect you?" he asked.
"You have, doubtless, some preliminary arrangements
to make, for which you will
please take whatever time you may require.
Meanwhile, accept this sum in advance."</p>

<p>He drew from his pocket-book a fifty-dollar
note, which he handed to Mrs. Codman. She
could not feel any embarrassment in accepting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
a sum so tendered, and bowing her thanks, intimated
that she would make her appearance on
the following Monday, it being now Thursday.</p>

<p>The advance payment proved very acceptable
to Mrs. Codman, as with it she was enabled
to replenish her wardrobe, a step
rendered necessary by her residence in Mr.
Bowman's family. She was busily engaged
for the remainder of the week in supplying
its deficiencies.</p>

<p>No one could be more overjoyed than was
the humble washer-woman at the success of
her friend, of which she felt sure from the
first, knowing Mrs. Codman to be a <i>rale lady</i>.
The latter, feeling that she owed her present
good fortune mainly to the zealous recommendation
of her friendly neighbor, purchased
a neat dress, which Mrs. O'Grady was prevailed
upon to accept, on being convinced
she would not thereby be distressing herself,
a fact of which she was assured on being told
of Mr. Bowman's liberality.</p>

<p>Yet there was, as the reader well knows,
one thought which contributed to diminish
the joy which Mrs. Codman would otherwise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
have felt at being restored, in a measure, to
the mode of life to which she had been accustomed,
and relieved from the necessity of
unremitting labor in order to sustain life.
This was, the thought of Charlie, her own
brave, handsome boy, who had been the joy
and life of her little household, now gone,&mdash;she
knew not whither. The uncertainty as
to his fate cost her many a sleepless night.
She was sustained, however, by a strong confidence
that he was yet living, and had little
doubt that the suggestion of Peter Manson
was correct, that he had been carried off by
the captain of some vessel short of hands.
Of course, she did not for an instant harbor
the suspicion that Peter himself had had anything
to do with his disappearance, being
quite unaware that any motive existed powerful
enough to tempt the old man to such a
crime.</p>

<p>"I shall hear from him; I shall see him
again," she said, with earnest conviction. "He
is under the eye of Providence, wherever he
may be, and no harm shall befall him."</p>

<p>Still, even with this strong feeling of trust,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
there was an uncertainty about the time when
her wishes could be realized, which could not
fail to weigh upon the mother's heart. Then
there was the constant longing for his bright
and enlivening presence, greater, because he
was her only child, and she was a widow.</p>

<p>The furniture which Mrs. Codman had in
her rooms she was enabled to dispose of
without a very great sacrifice. She reserved
a few articles, endeared to her by association,
which she stored in the room of her friendly
neighbor.</p>

<p>With her, also, she left a sum of money,
sufficient to pay for her month's rent, which
would not be due for a fortnight after her
removal to the house of Mr. Bowman. Peter
Manson was not a little surprised and disappointed
when, on visiting his tenant,&mdash;prepared
to witness her distress and hear
entreaties for a reduction of her rent,&mdash;to find
her already gone, and to hear that she had
obtained an advantageous situation, though
where, he was unable to ascertain, as Mrs.
O'Grady, with whom he was no favorite, was
not disposed to be communicative.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>

<p>Leaving Mrs. Codman thus comfortably
provided for, we must now follow the fortunes
of our young hero, Charlie, whom we
left securely bound in the forecastle of the
Bouncing Betsey.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter">
<h2>XVI.<br /> <small>THE BEGINNING OF CHARLIE'S SEA-LIFE.</small></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> the Bouncing Betsey was fairly out
to sea, Captain Brace, anticipating, with the
malicious delight which a petty tyrant feels
in the sufferings of those subject to him, the
grief and terror of our young hero, ordered
Charlie to be released from his bonds and
brought before him.</p>

<p>This order the mate chose to execute in
person.</p>

<p>The pressure of the cords, with which he
had been bound, had chafed his limbs, and
the constraint of his position had made them
ache.</p>

<p>As the mate busied himself in unbinding
him, Charlie inquired, with a glimmering of
hope, "Are you going to let me go?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>

<p>"Where?" asked Randall.</p>

<p>"On shore."</p>

<p>"Perhaps you don't know that, by this
time, we are at least forty miles from Boston."</p>

<p>"Could you send me back?" asked Charlie,
his heart sinking within him.</p>

<p>"I suppose we might turn the ship about,
and go back for your accommodation," said
the mate, with a sneer; "but I don't think
Capt. Brace would consent."</p>

<p>"Is there no way?" implored Charlie.
"Couldn't you put me on board some ship
going back?"</p>

<p>"You can speak to the captain about that.
He has sent for you. Come along, and don't
be all day about it."</p>

<p>Charlie stretched himself with the intent
of gaining some relief from the stricture he
had suffered, and prepared to do what he
knew there was no means of evading, he followed
Randall to the presence of Capt. Brace.</p>

<p>"Well, Jack," said Capt. Brace, showing
his teeth in an unpleasant manner, "how do
you like life on shipboard?"</p>

<p>"My name is not Jack," was our hero's reply.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span></p>

<p>"Indeed! Perhaps you will do me the favor
to tell me what is it."</p>

<p>"My name," said our hero, not liking the
captain's tone, "is Charlie Codman."</p>

<p>"So you pretend to be wiser than your
uncle," said Capt. Brace, looking towards the
mate.</p>

<p>"He is not my uncle," said Charlie, boldly.
If he had felt it to be prudent, he would have
added that he had no desire for a relationship to
Randall, but he knew that it would not be wise.</p>

<p>"Do you dare to contradict my first officer?"
demanded the captain, with a frown.</p>

<p>"I am only telling the truth," said Charlie,
undauntedly.</p>

<p>"<i>Silence!</i>" roared the captain, in a passion.
"If he chooses to call you his nephew, you
shall be so; do you hear that? I say, do you
hear that?" he repeated, pounding with his
clenched fist upon the table before him.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," said our hero.</p>

<p>"Take care that you remember it then.
Your name, henceforth, is Jack Randall,&mdash;at
any rate, as long as you remain aboard
this ship."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>

<p>"How long am I to remain on board, sir?"
Charlie could not help asking.</p>

<p>"How long?" repeated the captain.
"<i>Forever</i>, if I choose. And now as this is
the last conversation which I intend to hold
with you on this point, you will bear in mind
that you are shipped on board this vessel as
a boy, and that, if you don't do your duty
you'll get&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>We suppress the word with which the
captain closed his sentence, not being willing
to soil our pages with it.</p>

<p>This was rather a hard trial for our young
hero, accustomed to a mother's gentle and
affectionate words. Had he been less manly,
he would have burst into tears; but he only
turned pale a little, and bit his lips.</p>

<p>"Take him on deck, Mr. Randall, and set
him to work," said the captain; "and mind,
Jack, that I don't hear any complaints of
you."</p>

<p>Charlie followed the mate to the deck.
He had made up his mind that he must stay
in the ship during the voyage, or, at all
events until they reached land somewhere,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
and resolved that, since it was forced upon
him, he would do his duty as well as he could,
and so afford as little advantage as possible to
those who seemed determined to persecute him.</p>

<p>He was set to work by Randall, who told
him, in a sharp tone, to "mind his eye and
keep to work, if he knew what was best for
himself."</p>

<p>The work was not difficult, but Charlie's
fingers were unpractised, and he might very
soon have incurred the wrath of the captain
and mate, if Bill Sturdy, the sailor whose
friendly advances to our hero have already
been noticed, had not approached him, the
mate being temporarily out of earshot, and
given him a little instruction.</p>

<p>"Well, my lad, what news?" inquired
Bill. "Shipped for the voyage, are you?"</p>

<p>"That's what the captain and mate say,"
returned Charlie.</p>

<p>"They're a pair of precious rascals," said
Bill, lowering his voice, "and it's my opinion
they're well matched, so far as villainy goes."</p>

<p>"What made you ship on board the vessel?"
inquired Charlie.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>

<p>"Bless your soul, boy, I wouldn't a done
it if I'd known who was in command; leastways,
if I had known a little more about him.
But I didn't ask any questions. I had just
got in from a v'y'ge to Calcutta, and happened
to see one of my old shipmates, Jim Davis,
walking on the wharf. 'Bill,' says he, 'why
won't you ship along of me?' I asked him
where he was bound, and he telled me to
Valparaiso, on board the Bouncing Betsey.
Well, I've been most everywhere else, but I
had never been there, and reckoned I should
like to see it. Besides, I'd got tired of going
to Calcutta. I've been there, man and boy,
six or eight times. It's too hot to live there
some parts of the year. So I just told him
I was in for it if he was, provided there was
a vacancy. I asked him if he knew anything
about the officers. He said he didn't, but he
guessed they would pass. So I just stepped
into the office and shipped. There, lad, that's
the whole story. I don't mind it much myself.
They don't generally meddle much with me."</p>

<p>"Have you sailed with bad captains before?"
inquired our hero.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, my lad, sometimes. One captain I
sailed with&mdash;I was a young man then&mdash;was
Captain Maguire. He was a sort of an Irishman,
I surmise, and mighty fond of drink.
He was pleasant enough when he was sober,
but that wasn't often. When he was drunk,
he got into a regular fury. He would tear
round the deck like as he was crazy, and so
he was after a fashion, for he didn't seem to
know, after he had got out of his fits, what
he had done when he was in 'em. One day,
I remember, as I was at work, he came up to
me, and gave me a terrible thwack side of the
head, swearing like a trooper all the time."</p>

<p>"What did you do?" asked Charlie, looking
up with interest into the weather-beaten
face of the old sailor.</p>

<p>"I'll tell you," said Sturdy; "you see, I'm
pretty strong," glancing at his brawny arms
and herculean frame with pardonable complacency;
"I don't often meet a man I can't
manage as easily as the mate can manage you.
Now the captain wasn't a large man, by any
means, nor very strong, either. As to the
mates,&mdash;one of them was sick in his berth,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
and the other was in another part of the ship;
so I just took the captain up in my arms,
and carried him down to the cabin, kickin'
and cursin', as might be expected, and laid
him down there. The officers did not see
what was goin' on, or there'd have been
trouble. As for the crew, they enjoyed it,
and wouldn't a man of 'em tell; and as the
captain didn't remember anything about it
the next day, I didn't get punished."</p>

<p>"Did you ever get punished?" asked
Charlie.</p>

<p>"Never since I grew up, and had these to
fight my way with," said Bill Sturdy, showing
his fists, which looked as if a blow from
either of them would have felled an ox. "No,
my lad, these are what I call my sledge-hammers,
and I'd as lives have them to rely
upon as a pair of pistols."</p>

<p>At this point in the conversation Bill was
called off to some other part of the vessel,
and the mate coming up discovered, somewhat
to his disappointment, that our hero
had discharged his task in a manner which
did not admit of censure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p>

<h2>XVII.<br /> <small>THE RIVAL CHAMPIONS.</small></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is customary to divide a ship's crew into
two watches, whose duty it is to alternate in
keeping a lookout at night. The first night-watch
commences at eight o'clock, and continues
till midnight. This watch is then relieved
by the second, who have had an
opportunity of sleeping in the mean time, and
who remain on duty till four A. M. They
then give place to the first, who are again on
duty till eight in the morning. Thus it will
be seen that a part of the crew have eight
hours' sleep, while the remainder have but
four. This inequality, however, is remedied
the next evening, when the hours are changed.</p>

<p>Charlie was fortunate in one respect. He
was placed on the same watch with Bill
Sturdy, who had established himself, in some
sort, as the boy's protector, and did not scruple
to avow it. When some of the crew began
to tease and play rough practical jokes upon
Charlie,&mdash;a mode of treatment to which boys<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
are frequently subjected on board ship,&mdash;Bill
Sturdy interfered, and in a sonorous voice
exclaimed,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Look here, shipmates, don't lay a finger
on this boy!"</p>

<p>"And why not?" inquired a burly sailor,
with naturally repulsive features.</p>

<p>"Because I say so," retorted Bill Sturdy.</p>

<p>"Who is he, I should like to know, that
we are to keep our distance?"</p>

<p>"I'll tell you who he is, shipmates," was
the answer. "He's a boy that the mate has
entrapped on board without his own consent."</p>

<p>"Isn't he the mate's nephew?"</p>

<p>"No more than I am, though the mate
chooses to call him so. He's got a mother
living in Boston, and he's her only boy. She
doesn't know what has become of him. Now,
shipmates, he seems to be a fine lad, and I'm
going to stand by him for his sake and his
mother's."</p>

<p>Sailors are generous when you reach their
hearts, and there was a murmur of approbation
when Bill concluded.</p>

<p>But there is no rule without an exception,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
and that exception was the scowling sailor
who has already been mentioned. Few knew
much about him. This was his second voyage
on board the Bouncing Betsey. Next to Bill
Sturdy he was the stoutest and most athletic
sailor on board the ship. During the previous
voyage he had been the bully of the crew,
taking advantage of his personal strength.
Now they were relieved from his tyranny. In
Bill Sturdy he had more than found his match.
No one, comparing the two men, could doubt,
that in a contest, the odds would be decidedly
in favor of Bill. Antonio, for this was his
name, for he was a Spaniard by birth, could
not help seeing the changed state of affairs.
Now no one likes to be eclipsed, and to see
the authority passing from his hands into
those of another. Certainly Antonio did not
behold this transfer with indifference. He
could not brook holding the second place,
where the first had been his. But how could
he help it? Very evidently the opinions of
the crew favored Bill Sturdy; not only because
they believed him to excel Antonio in
physical qualities, which hold a high value in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
the eyes of a sailor, but because he had, as
yet, shown no disposition to abuse his power.
Antonio was resolved not to yield without a
struggle, and therefore determined to take
the first occasion to pick a quarrel with his
rival, as this would give him an opportunity
to measure his strength with him. Antonio
did not see, what was evident to all else, that
his rival was undeniably his superior in prowess.
People are generally slow to admit their
own inferiority. That is only natural. He
hoped, therefore, that he should be able to
re-establish his supremacy by coming off a
conqueror in the contest which he had determined
to do all in his power to bring about.</p>

<p>Antonio's attention had not been especially
called to our hero, until he heard Bill Sturdy
avow his determination to take him under his
protection. Then, in a spirit of perverseness,
and because he thought it would open the
way for the trial of strength which he courted,
he resolved to oppose him, and openly espouse
the other side.</p>

<p>Accordingly, when the murmurs of applause,
which had been elicited by his rival's frank<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
and generous appeal to the sympathies of the
crew, had subsided, Antonio looked round on
the rough faces which surrounded him, and
growled,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Well, shipmates, are you going to submit
to what this fellow says? He dares you to
touch this snivelling milk-sop of a boy."</p>

<p>Some of the faces grew dark and threatening
at this representation. Nothing stirs up
a sailor's heart to opposition so readily as
anything which resembles a threat.</p>

<p>Bill Sturdy hastened to reply.</p>

<p>"He is wrong. I don't threaten any of
you. I only ask if it is right to play tricks,
and abuse a boy who has already been treated
so scurvily by the mate. I don't believe
there's any one of you that wants to curry
favor with Mr. Randall and the captain. Now
there is nothing they will like better than to
see you kicking round this lad."</p>

<p>Neither the captain nor the mate stood very
high in the good graces of the crew, and the
effect produced by this statement showed
that it was adroitly conceived.</p>

<p>Bill Sturdy took advantage of this to add,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
"Now, lads, when I say I am going to stand
by this boy, and see that he isn't abused, I
know you'll stand by me."</p>

<p>This frank and bold speech produced a
decided reaction in favor of Charlie.</p>

<p>There was another murmur of approbation,
which was interrupted by a stamp upon the
deck by Antonio, who, with a ferocious contortion
of countenance, shouted, "If you're
all going to follow this man's lead, and do
like dogs whatever he bids you, you'll find
there's one here that dares to be independent."</p>

<p>Saying this, he advanced suddenly to
Charlie, who was at work near by, and, seizing
him by the shoulder, was about to proceed
to some act of violence.</p>

<p>As soon as Bill Sturdy perceived his design,
he sprang forward and gave him a powerful
blow which would have felled him to
the deck, had not Bill slipped a little, as he
delivered it.</p>

<p>Instantly the Spaniard's sallow face was
suffused, and, with a torrent of oaths and a
howl of fury, he precipitated himself upon
Sturdy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>

<p>But it was easier to catch a weasel asleep,
than to take the stout sailor unprepared.</p>

<p>With his feet firmly planted upon the deck,
and his fists in a proper position, he received
the bully, parrying his blows with wonderful
dexterity, and succeeding in planting others
no less effective.</p>

<p>A ring of sailors gathered around, eager to
watch the progress and termination of the
affray. There were not a few among them,
who enjoyed the punishment which they
foresaw the Spaniard would receive from his
antagonist. He had so tyrannized over them
in the past, that they felt little sympathy for
him now.</p>

<p>Baffled, blinded, and howling with mingled
rage and vexation, the Spaniard continued
the unequal fight. As for Bill Sturdy, he
was cool and collected, apparently neither
angry nor excited, but wary and on the alert.</p>

<p>At length Antonio, perceiving a marlinespike
at a little distance, sprang towards it.
It was a critical moment for Bill Sturdy, for
a marlinespike, in the hands of a furious and
determined man, is a formidable weapon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span></p>

<p>His movement did not escape the notice of
Sturdy.</p>

<p>He had acted principally on the defensive
thus far, but he now saw that something decisive
must be done.</p>

<p>Springing forward, he closed with his assailant,
lifted him from the deck, and, carrying
him to the companion-way, hurled him
down stairs.</p>

<p>Then, turning to the crew, he exclaimed,
"Shipmates, I call you to witness that this
quarrel was forced upon me. Have I done
right or wrong?"</p>

<p>"Right!" exclaimed all, in concert.</p>

<p>At this moment the mate, attracted by the
noise, came on deck.</p>

<h2>XVIII.<br /> <small>ANTONIO'S RESOLVE.</small></h2>

<p>"<span class="smcap">What</span> has been going on?" asked Randall,
perceiving, from the position of the
sailors and their looks, that something had
happened. What it was, he surmised, having
heard something of the noise of the conflict.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>

<p>No one of the sailors spoke, but all looked
at each other in hesitating silence.</p>

<p>"What was it? Are you all deaf?" demanded
the mate, impatiently.</p>

<p>"A little fight, that is all, Mr. Randall,"
answered Bill Sturdy, coolly hitching up his
pants.</p>

<p>"And you were one of the parties?"</p>

<p>"I believe I was."</p>

<p>"And who was the other?"</p>

<p>"Antonio."</p>

<p>"And where is he now?"</p>

<p>"He has gone below," said Bill, in a significant
tone.</p>

<p>"What was the fight about?" inquired
Randall, who, in ordinary cases, would not
have cared to pursue the subject farther, but
had an undefined idea that it was in some
way connected with our hero, for whom he
felt no peculiar affection.</p>

<p>"The fact is," said Bill Sturdy, "Antonio
undertook to abuse that lad there," pointing
to Charlie; "and I ain't one to stand by and
see a boy abused. Besides," he added, with
a latent humor which all understood, though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
he did not allow it to alter the gravity of his
countenance, "I knew he was your nephew,
and that made me the more anxious to defend
him."</p>

<p>Randall was placed in an awkward predicament.
He could not deny that Charlie was
his nephew after his express declaration to
that effect, while at the same time the relationship
which he claimed was far from exciting,
in his own mind, any attachment for the
boy. Still it closed his mouth for the time.
He only muttered, in an undertone, that the
boy must fight his own battles, and disappeared
from the deck.</p>

<p>"Fight his own battles!" repeated Sturdy,
indignantly. "A pretty sort of an uncle he
is, to match a boy of fourteen against a grown
man, and a strong one at that. However,"
added Sturdy, complacently, "the lad's got a
friend that is a match for Antonio at any
time."</p>

<p>"That he has," answered a comrade; "but
I say, Bill; I couldn't help laughing to see
how you made that old shark shut up his
mouth by telling him it was his nephew you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
were fighting for. It made him mad, but he
didn't know what to say against it."</p>

<p>"His nephew! No, Jack, it's well the lad
isn't any kith or kin of his. A drop of his
blood would be enough to spile a decent lad."</p>

<p>"Ay, that it would."</p>

<p>Presently Antonio came on deck with a
sullen air, half of defiance, half of humiliation,
at his recent defeat. He smarted under the
conviction, that henceforth his authority
among the crew would be small. Hitherto
he had been the champion and bully of the
quarter-deck, and although the crew had no
liking for him, but rather a decided feeling of
an opposite nature, yet strength and prowess
always command a certain rude respect among
sailors, and that respect he enjoyed. But now
all was changed. He had been beaten, and
that in a fair fight, where all could see that
no underhand means had been employed.
Strength had been matched against strength,
and he had come off second best. That had
been a Waterloo day to him, and he knew
that he returned to the deck no longer the
same man so far as consideration went.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span></p>

<p>Bill Sturdy was a generous antagonist.
He had no idea of indulging in exultation
over his vanquished foe, but treated him as
if nothing had happened.</p>

<p>But Antonio's resentment was deep and
implacable. He thirsted for revenge, and
determined to lull to sleep the suspicions of
his late opponent, until some opportunity
should present itself for an effectual and safe
revenge.</p>

<p>Accordingly he suddenly recovered from his
sullenness, and made some half advances towards
Sturdy, which the latter met, but not
without reserve.</p>

<p>"I can't kind o' feel as if the feller was to
be trusted," said Bill to Charlie, one evening,
as they were alone together. "There's something
in his eye that I don't like; a sort of
deceitful gleam, as if there was something
covered up that he didn't like to show. For
my part, I like to be fair and above board,
and show just what I am."</p>

<p>"I'm sorry you have made an enemy of this
man on my account," said Charlie.</p>

<p>"Avast, my lad, do you think I was going<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
to stand still and let him abuse you? Thank
heaven, old Bill Sturdy isn't such a lubber as
that."</p>

<p>"But he may do you a mischief yet, Bill."</p>

<p>"Let him come within the reach of my
arm," said Bill, swinging his brawny right
arm as he would a flail, "I guess he wouldn't
want to try it again."</p>

<p>"But he may take you at advantage."</p>

<p>"He will have to get up early in the
morning, then," said Sturdy, in a tone of confidence.
"No lubberly foreigner is likely to
get ahead of Bill Sturdy, I can tell you that,
my lad."</p>

<p>Both Bill and Charlie supposed that they
were alone, and that this conversation was
unheard by any other person, but in this they
were mistaken.</p>

<p>On the other side of the mast crouched the
dark figure of a man, who seemed to be listening
intently to the conversation between the
two. He remained very quiet, fearing, doubtless,
that he should be observed. Evidently
what he heard did not affect him pleasantly.
His brow contracted, and a scowl of hatred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
made his features look even more dark and
forbidding than was their wont, especially
when Bill Sturdy made use of the last
expression, his face exhibited a concentrated
malice, which could only have been generated
in a heart full of evil passions.</p>

<p>He ground his white teeth together and
muttered to himself, as he crept cautiously
from his place of concealment, and made his
way to his bunk in the forecastle. "We
shall see, we shall see. No man shall insult
and triumph over me without repenting of it.
He shall know, some time, what it is to excite
the vengeance of a desperate man. He thinks
the lion has become a lamb. He will find out
his mistake."</p>

<p>Antonio might more appropriately have
compared himself to a serpent, for his character
had more of the subtlety of the noxious
reptile than of the boldness and freedom of
the monarch of the forest.</p>

<p>Unconscious of the concealed listener to
their discourse, Bill Sturdy and our young
friend continued their conversation. In the
hours of darkness, when night broods upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
the ocean, and no sound is to be heard save
the dashing of the waves against the sides of
the vessel, the sailor who is obliged to stand
his watch would find the hours pass wearily
if it were not for some method of killing the
time. Among these is the spinning of yarns,
for which sailors are so noted. This it was
that occurred to Bill, as he stood with Charlie
leaning over the side.</p>

<p>"I say, my lad, suppose we spin a yarn
apiece, and that will make the time pass
quicker."</p>

<p>"But I am not an old sailor, Bill; I don't
know anything about spinning yarns."</p>

<p>"Tush, lad, I don't expect a salt-water yarn
from you. I want a land yarn. I am sure,
you have read a good many, and can think of
one now. Just lead off, and when you get
through, I'll try my hand at it."</p>

<p>Thus adjured, Charlie said, "Let me think
a minute."</p>

<p>Bill leaned over the rail in silent expectation.</p>

<h2>XIX.<br /> <small>CHARLIE'S LAND YARN.</small></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlie</span> deliberated a moment, when he
chanced to think of Nicholas Nickleby, the
only one of Dickens's works he had ever
read, and which, as it had interested him
exceedingly, had impressed itself upon his
remembrance.</p>

<p>"Did you ever hear of Nicholas Nickleby,
Bill?" he inquired.</p>

<p>"Yes," was Bill's unexpected response;
"when I was at Liverpool three years ago,
she was lying alongside our ship."</p>

<p>"She!" exclaimed Charlie, in amazement.</p>

<p>"Yes," answered Sturdy, in a matter-of-fact
tone, "she was a very good craft, and was in
the West India trade. I saw considerable of
her, being as how I got acquainted with Tom
Seagrove, one of the men on board."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I see what you mean," said
Charlie; "but I don't mean a ship, I mean a
story of the same name."</p>

<p>"No, I never heard of it. Named after the
ship, like enough."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span></p>

<p>Charlie thought it more probable that the
vessel was named after the story, but as this
was a point of little importance to the present
occasion, he passed it by, and continued,
"Well, Bill, it's a very interesting story, and
as I remember that about as well as anything
I ever read, I believe I will tell you part of it."</p>

<p>"Heave ahead, my lad."</p>

<p>"You must know that this Nicholas Nickleby
was a young man whose father died when
he was about nineteen, leaving him very little
money, but a mother and sister to provide
for. He had an old uncle Ralph, who was
very rich, but an old rascal, who didn't trouble
himself about his poor relations."</p>

<p>"That's the way with a good many rich
people," said Bill. "They leave the smaller
craft to shift for themselves."</p>

<p>"However, on being applied to, he did
manage to get the sister a place in a millinery
establishment, and, as for Nicholas, he got
him a place as assistant teacher in a country
boarding-school."</p>

<p>"He was a sort of first mate in the school,
wasn't he?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, something like that, only he didn't
fare half so well as a mate or any kind of an
officer. All the old fellow gave him for his
services was about twenty-five dollars a year
and board."</p>

<p>"What made him ship on board the craft,
then?"</p>

<p>"It was the only chance he had, so he
thought he'd take it till he could find a
better."</p>

<p>"What was the captain's name?" asked Bill,
who stuck to his marine phraseology.</p>

<p>"His name was Squeers, and a tough old
fellow he was. He had some thirty or forty
boarding scholars, whom he treated shamefully.
In the first place, he didn't allow them
enough to eat."</p>

<p>"Why didn't they mutiny, and pitch the
lubber overboard?" exclaimed Bill, indignantly.</p>

<p>"Because he had starved the spirit out of
them. Besides, they were mostly small, and
he had a wife as bad as himself, as well as a
daughter who was&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"A chip of the old block."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span></p>

<p>"Exactly. Do you want to know how he
took away their appetites so that they wouldn't
eat so much? He used to make them swallow
a spoonful of boiling hot molasses, which
scalded their throats, and made it hard for
them to swallow."</p>

<p>"I'd like to have overhauled him," said
Sturdy.</p>

<p>"If you had, I don't believe there'd have
been much left of him, for he was a spindling
sort of a man, tall and thin."</p>

<p>"And how did the young fellow like his
place?"</p>

<p>"Not very much. He found they were
going to half-starve him, too. However, he
wouldn't have minded that so much as seeing
the poor children abused. While all this was
going on, the school-master's daughter fell in
love with him."</p>

<p>"Was she pretty?"</p>

<p>"No," said Charlie. "She was the image
of her father, and he wasn't anything of a
beauty. She was thin, with a hatchet face
and yellow hair. However, she continued to
make herself think that Nicholas was in love<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
with her, and one day, when her father and
mother were gone to London to get a new
scholar, she posted off to a female friend of
hers, and told her that she had got a beau,
and invited her friend and her beau to come
to tea. When tea-time came, there they all
were in the sitting-room, drinking tea, and
faring a great deal better than Nicholas had
before, since he had been at the school, when
the other young lady and her beau began to
poke fun at Nicholas, all on account of Matilda
Squeers, whom they supposed him to be in
love with. He didn't understand it at all,
and told them so.</p>

<p>"'Why,' said John Brodie,&mdash;that was the
other girl's beau,&mdash;'ain't you courtin' Tilda,
here?'</p>

<p>"Nicholas protested that he never so much
as thought of the thing. At this, Matilda
turned all sorts of colors, for she had confidently
told both of them that he was in love
with her, and, besides, she had no idea that
a poor, under-paid teacher would think of refusing
her, the&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Captain's daughter," suggested Bill Sturdy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span></p>

<p>"Exactly so. So you see the tea-party
didn't end quite so pleasantly as it began, and
from that moment Nicholas had a bitter
enemy in the daughter of his employer."</p>

<p>"That's the way with female craft," said
Bill. "What happened next?"</p>

<p>"Mr. and Mrs. Squeers came home, bringing
the new boy with them. The first thing
they did was to give a whipping all round,
to make up for the time they'd been away."</p>

<p>"I wish I'd been there," said Bill, swinging
his brawny arms.</p>

<p>"Among the scholars was one, worse treated
than the rest, named Smike. He had been
with them ever since he was a boy of six or
eight, and his friends had deserted him. Mr.
Squeers would have cast him off, only he
found his work more than paid for the scanty
food he ate, so he kept him; but he was so
beaten and cuffed, and made to drudge so
constantly, that it would have been better for
him if he had been turned away. At last he
determined to run away."</p>

<p>"Good for him!" said Bill.</p>

<p>"As soon as Mr. Squeers found he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
gone, he went after him post haste, and, as the
boy was weak and couldn't travel very fast,
he soon overtook him, and brought him back,
bound hand and foot, in the chaise. He suspected
that Nicholas had helped Smike to
escape, so he determined to inflict a cruel
punishment upon him in presence of his assistant.
Accordingly, he armed himself with
a large whip, and, calling all the school together,
he told Smike to strip, and was just
about to lay the whip on his naked back
when Nicholas shouted out 'Stop!' Squeers
glared round, and said in a fierce voice, 'Who
said that?' 'I said it,' said Nicholas; 'I tell
you, stop!' Squeers turned white with rage,
and threatened to whip Nicholas, also. He
was about to commence the punishment, when
Nicholas sprang from his seat, and, pulling
the whip from his hand, knocked Squeers
over, and began to belabor him with his own
whip."</p>

<p>"Good!" exclaimed Bill, who had become
much interested in the narrative. "I hope
he made him scream for mercy."</p>

<p>"So he did, and Nicholas kept on belaboring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
him, notwithstanding Mrs. Squeers and
her daughter went at him tooth and nail, and
tried to pull him off. But he was so excited
with anger that he felt strong enough to cope
with half a dozen, and never left off till
Squeers was black and blue and aching all
over."</p>

<p>"Hurrah for Nicholas!" shouted Bill
Sturdy, in great delight, at the school-master's
discomfiture. "What happened next?"</p>

<p>"Nicholas packed up his clothes and left
the house, but took care to carry Smike with
him, knowing that he would otherwise fare
badly."</p>

<p>"And what became of Nicholas afterwards?
Did he reach port?"</p>

<p>"He met with a variety of adventures, but
at length became rich and happy."</p>

<p>"That's a pretty good yarn," said Bill
Sturdy. "I should have liked to help him
whip the school-master, though."</p>

<p>"Now, Bill, I am ready to hear your yarn,"
said Charlie.</p>

<h2>XX.<br /> <small>BILL STURDY'S STORY.</small></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">After</span> pausing a moment to collect his
ideas, Bill Sturdy commenced his story.</p>

<p>"It was, mayhap, twelve years ago, or it
might have been thirteen, since I sailed from
New York in the ship Peregrine, bound for
Havana. The Peregrine was quite a sizable
ship, and I expected a pleasant voyage, as the
captain was a frank, good-humored looking
man. So he was when he was in his sober
senses, but, unfortunately, this wasn't always
the case. However, he used to keep pretty
straight when he was at home, for if he had
shown himself out it might have been hard
for him to get employment. If Jack gets
drunk it's no serious damage to the ship, but
if the chief officer, to whom all look for commands,
allows himself to drink too much,
especially when a storm threatens, it's a pretty
bad matter. You see, my lad, that when a
captain is drunk, he does not generally know
it himself, and is apt to think that he is perfectly
able to manage the ship.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, Captain Harvey, for that was his
name, was an excellent seaman when he was
sober. He was a thorough sailor, and knew
every rope in the ship. But, as it happened,
it would have been better if we had had a
captain who knew less and kept sober.</p>

<p>"Captain Harvey kept pretty straight at
first, as I was saying, and we men began to
like him. He was a pleasant-spoken man,
though he meant to be obeyed when he gave
an order. I liked him all the better, because
the captain I had gone with last was a different
kind of man. It wasn't always a word
and a blow with Captain Lafarge, but oftentimes
the blow came first. Well, times
seemed changed, and that was what I was
saying to a messmate of mine, who had sailed
with me under the other captain, when Captain
Harvey came on deck. That was the
third day out; his face looked unusually red,
and his eyes bloodshot. He staggered up to
us, gave me a blow side of the head, as he
said, or rather hiccoughed, for he couldn't
speak very plain, 'Wh&mdash;what are you&mdash;hic&mdash;doing
there, you rascal?'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span></p>

<p>"Now, my lad, I'm not one to stand a blow
very patiently; I'm rather apt to resent it,
and so I should this time, but as I looked up
I saw how matters stood, and that took away
my anger. I liked Captain Harvey, and I
knew that when he was right he would never
think of giving me a blow without any cause,
so I didn't do anything, but answered, as
respectful as I could,&mdash;</p>

<p>"'I hope I am doing my duty, Captain
Harvey.'</p>

<p>"'You lie,' he stuttered again.</p>

<p>"I did not feel called upon to give any
answer to this charge. It was as well that I
didn't, for he waited a minute and then left
me.</p>

<p>"Well, this was the first that any of us
knew of the captain's habits. We were all
sorry, even those that liked to drink themselves,
for this was the only fault we could
detect in our chief officer, and it was a pretty
serious one, as it turned out. I told you,
didn't I, that we were bound for Havana?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Charlie.</p>

<p>"Well, it sometimes happens that there are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
violent storms in those latitudes, and the coast
is dangerous to approach. Time passed, and
although Captain Harvey would have his
blow-out now and then, yet there had been
no particular damage so far, perhaps because
we had had pretty quiet weather. Now,
however, we had got into the region of gales,
and we all hoped the captain would keep
sober.</p>

<p>"But that wasn't to be.</p>

<p>"One morning, I remember, we had a powerful
gale. The ship was behaving pretty
well under it. She was a staunch craft when
we started, and bade fair to see a great many
years' service. So, on the whole, we didn't
feel uneasy till the captain came on deck.</p>

<p>"We saw at once that he was drunk, a
good deal drunk, and not fit to take care of
the ship. He staggered up to the mate, and
asked him how fast the ship was going.</p>

<p>"The mate reported, ten knots an hour.</p>

<p>"'Ten knots an hour!' repeated the captain,
contemptuously. 'Is that all? We
must go faster.'</p>

<p>"'But, Captain Harvey,' said the mate,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
'there is a violent gale. Do you think it
prudent to increase our speed?'</p>

<p>"'Prudent!' thundered the captain, 'do
you think I would give the order if I didn't
think so? Not a word more, sir, but call all
hands, and make sail.'</p>

<p>"Nothing was to be done but to obey.</p>

<p>"Accordingly the reefs were let out of the
topsails, the top gallant sails set, and even
the fore top-mast studding sail. Now, my
lad, although you are not much of a sailor,
you can understand that it was perfect madness
to carry so much sail in such a tempest.
I knew at once what would happen, and prepared
for the worst. There was a hen-coop
lying on deck, and I resolved, that if the
worst should come to the worst, I would
spring for that.</p>

<p>"The worst did come to the worst. The
ship pitched about like a mad thing, and
creaked and groaned as if she were a human
being in the greatest distress, and I can tell
you the sailors looked black enough. We felt
that our lives were being risked, and all for
the intemperance of one man. That scene<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
cured me of drinking grog. I haven't drank
a drop since."</p>

<p>"Did anything happen to the ship?"</p>

<p>"Yes, my lad, something did happen to the
ship. A heavy sea struck her amidships, and
pitched her over upon her side. After we
recovered, we found that she was strained
severely and leaking badly. Well, the end
of it was, that we had to abandon her. The
rest of the crew got on board the boats, but
there wasn't fairly room, and they were so
overloaded that I thought it would be safer
trusting to the old hen-coop. They tried to
get me on board the boats, but I had a kind
of suspicion that the boats wouldn't live. So
I stuffed all my pockets with biscuit, filled a
tin measure with water, and trusted myself to
the hen-coop."</p>

<p>"Did the boats live?" inquired Charlie,
with interest.</p>

<p>"Not a single one. They were never
heard from again. No doubt they all went
down in the storm.</p>

<p>"Well, my lad, it wasn't the pleasantest
thing pitching about on a hen-coop on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
wild sea, fifty miles, at least, from land. But
my hope was, that I should be seen by some
vessel bound for Havana. In that case I
knew I would be safe. I had provision
enough to last me three days, and I could
make my water last as long by being sparing
of it. I had to hold on to the hen-coop
pretty tight, or I should have been washed off
by some of the heavy seas. Of course, I got
completely drenched by the salt water, and
what was worse, the biscuit got drenched too,
which didn't improve its taste, I can tell you.</p>

<p>"So I tossed about for twenty-four hours.
By this time the gale had gone down, and the
sea was more quiet. It was at this time that,
casting my eyes about to see if I could anywhere
catch sight of a sail, I descried one
apparently making towards me."</p>

<p>"Wer'n't you delighted?"</p>

<p>"I was at first," said Bill, "but as she came
nearer I tried not to attract her notice."</p>

<p>"Why?" asked Charlie, in great surprise.</p>

<p>"Because, my lad, <i>I recognized in her the
Red Rover, one of the most noted pirates that
cruised in those seas</i>."</p>

<h2>XXI.<br /> <small>THE PIRATE SHIP.</small></h2>

<p>"<span class="smcap">How</span> did you know she was a pirate?"
inquired Charlie.</p>

<p>"I suspected her in the first place, from her
rakish look. All pirate ships, you know, are
made for speed. Besides, this particular ship
had been described to me by a messmate who
had once been on board a ship that was chased
by her, though, luckily, before the pirate had
a chance to overhaul her, two other vessels
came in sight, and frightened her away.</p>

<p>"As soon as I made out the approaching
vessel to be the Red Rover, I repented bitterly
the signs by which I had drawn her
attention. I ceased making signals, but it
was too late. She had already seen me, and
a boat was filling with men to take me on
board. Finding I could not well help myself,
I concluded to make the best of it, and not
show any objection to going with the boat's
crew. So when they came near, and hailed
me, asking me who I was, I answered as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
heartily as I could, 'Bill Sturdy, of the good
ship Peregrine, bound for Havana.'</p>

<p>"'And what's become of your ship?'</p>

<p>"'Gone to the bottom,' I answered.</p>

<p>"'How long since?'</p>

<p>"'About twenty-four hours.'</p>

<p>"'How did it happen?'</p>

<p>"In reply, I told all the circumstances,
without reserve, for concealment would have
done no good.</p>

<p>"There was a little consultation on board
the boat, and then the officer in command
brought it up alongside my hen-coop, and
ordered me aboard.</p>

<p>"This I did with as much alacrity as possible,
and I tell you, my lad, it did seem good
once more to be in a boat, even though it
belonged to a pirate, after pitching about on
a hen-coop for twenty-four hours.</p>

<p>"Now that I had a chance, I looked at the
men that manned the boat. They were villainous-looking
cutthroats&mdash;mostly Spaniards,
with dark, lowering faces and forbidding expressions.
I couldn't help turning it over in my
mind, what they would be likely to do with me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span></p>

<p>"It didn't take long to reach the pirate
vessel. Those on board pressed forward, as
I came up and got on deck. They were all
pretty much alike. The captain was a large,
stout, muscular man, though I believe," added
Bill, with some complacency, "that I could
have got the better of him in a regular rough-and-tumble
fight. However, this isn't neither
here nor there. He came up to me, and made
me answer over again the same questions
which had been asked me before. I answered
them in the same way. After he had got
through with his questions, he fixed his sharp,
black eyes on me, and inquired, 'Do you know
the name of the ship that has picked you up?'</p>

<p>"'I do,' said I, coolly, though I didn't feel
as cool as I appeared.</p>

<p>"'Ha!' he exclaimed, in surprise. 'What
is it?'</p>

<p>"'It is the Red Rover,' said I, making
believe to be unconcerned.</p>

<p>"'And are you acquainted with its character?"
said the captain, with another of his
sharp looks.</p>

<p>"'I believe so,' said I.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>

<p>"'Name it.'</p>

<p>"'I think it is a pirate,' said I, not moving
a muscle.</p>

<p>"'Ha!' he exclaimed, looking at me rather
curiously. 'Are you not afraid to find yourself
on board a pirate?'</p>

<p>"'Why should I be?' I answered. 'But
for you, I should have died on the hen-coop,
and I suppose, if you had meant to take away
my life, you wouldn't have taken the trouble
to save me, since death was certain.'</p>

<p>"'A bold fellow!' said the captain, aside,
to the mate. He spoke in the Spanish language,
but I had managed to pick up some
odd phrases in that lingo, so I knew what he
was driving at. The mate seemed to agree,
and they talked a little more. I didn't
understand, but guessed it was about me.</p>

<p>"The pirate captain, after a short confab
with the mate, turned round, and spoke to
me. 'Well, my man,' said he, 'I don't mind
telling you that you've hit the mark in
guessing that this is the Red Rover, and a
pirate. I believe she has made something of
a reputation for herself,' he added, proudly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span></p>

<p>"I bowed.</p>

<p>"'Now I have a proposal to make to you.
We're rather short-handed. We need two or
three brave fellows, and I am inclined to
think, from your bearing, that you will suit
us. Now, if you would like it, you shall be
admitted to equal privileges with the rest of
the crew, with an equal share of whatever
booty we manage to pick up, and that I may
tell you, is not small. Here, Roderigo, step
forward, and tell this man how much your
share was last year.'</p>

<p>"Roderigo, a villainous-looking fellow,
stepped forward, and answered, 'Nearly two
thousand dollars in goods and money.'</p>

<p>"'You see, then, what are the inducements.
Will you join us or not?'</p>

<p>"Now I very well knew what the consequences
of my refusal would be, so I replied,
without a moment's hesitation, 'I will.'"</p>

<p>"What, did you become a pirate?" asked
Charlie, horror-struck.</p>

<p>"Pretty much in the same way that you
became a sailor, my lad; because I couldn't
help it."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span></p>

<p>"And did you join in robbing vessels, and
killing all on board?"</p>

<p>"Hold on, my lad; you're a little too fast
for me. You'll know in due time. The
pirate captain seemed pleased with my
promptness, and made me sign the book. I
should have given a wrong name, only I had
given the right one when I was hailed, though,
for that matter, Sturdy isn't my right name.
The captain told me, in a very polite sort of
way, that if I should undertake to play them
false, or interfere with them in any way, I
should be pitched overboard. As this threat
did not seem to trouble me much, he seemed
to be satisfied that it was all right with me.
In the course of a day or two, I got acquainted
with the crew. They were mostly Spaniards,
but there was a sprinkling of other nations,&mdash;French,
Danes, Germans, and one Englishman."</p>

<p>"Were there any Yankees?"</p>

<p>"No, I'm proud to say there wasn't one
except myself, and I wasn't there of my own
free will. Piracy doesn't chime in with our
Yankee notions, and it's my belief you'll find<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
precious few full-blooded Yankees that are
engaged in the business."</p>

<p>"How did you get out of their clutches?"
asked Charlie.</p>

<p>"That's what I'm coming to by and by.
For a few days we didn't meet a vessel, or, at
least, one that was alone, and so would do to
attack. I was glad of that, for I was ready
enough to do my duty on board the ship, but
I knew that, just as soon as we met a vessel,
I should be expected to do my share of the
fighting, and it went against my grain to engage
in any such villainous business as that.
However, I thought I wouldn't borrow
trouble, but wait till it came, and then I could
decide what to do.</p>

<p>"At last I heard the cry I so much dreaded,
'Sail ho!' from one of the crew, who had
been sent aloft to give notice of an approaching
vessel.</p>

<p>"'Where away?' shouted the pirate captain.</p>

<p>"'To the eastward.'</p>

<p>"Orders were at once given to change the
course of the vessel, and to make for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
stranger. As soon as she saw us she made
every effort to get away, but the Red Rover
was too swift for her. When we got within
a short distance, I made out the vessel to be
the Sally Ann, which had left port about the
time the Peregrine did. I knew some of those
on board very well, and the captain was an
old school-mate of mine.</p>

<p>"'What would they think,' I couldn't help
saying to myself, with a groan, 'if they knew
their old messmate was regularly enrolled
among the crew of the pirate that is overhauling
them?'"</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>XXII.<br /> <small>HOW TO ESCAPE FROM A PIRATE.</small></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Bill Sturdy</span> paused to take a whiff at his
pipe, and then resumed his story, in which
Charlie manifested no slight interest.</p>

<p>"I was taken all aback," he continued,
"when I found it was the Sally Ann I was
expected to join hands with the pirates
against. I couldn't help thinking of the many
pleasant hours I had spent on board that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
vessel, chatting and spinning yarns with the
crew. What to do I didn't know.</p>

<p>"The pirates were already clearing for action,
and all seemed as busy as bees. You
ought to have seen the eager look there was
on their villainous faces, as they watched the
Sally Ann, just, for all the world, like a
crafty spider, lying in wait for a fat fly.</p>

<p>"Just then the captain came up to where
I was standing, and fixed his sharp glance on
me. 'Now, my man,' said he, 'here's a chance
for you to distinguish yourself. That vessel
will no doubt prove a rich prize. Do your
duty, like a man, in the coming engagement,
and you shall have a good share of the spoils.
If you don't, or if you prove false to us, you
know your fate.'</p>

<p>"He pointed up to the yard-arm, as much
as to say that I should be strung up, if I refused
obedience, and I've no doubt he would
have kept his word.</p>

<p>"I just answered, 'Aye, aye, sir,' without
looking particularly concerned.</p>

<p>"'What will you do to the crew when the
ship has fallen into your hands?' I asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span></p>

<p>"'Send them to Davy Jones's locker,' he
said, with no more compunction than if he
were speaking of a litter of kittens.</p>

<p>"Well, I felt as if I was in a pretty tight
place; some like a man I've heard of somewhere,
who was being chased by a buffalo
across a large field. At last he came to a
precipice a hundred feet high. Of course, it
would be death for him to jump off, and it
would be just as much death for him to stay
where he was. So he just waited till the old
buffalo was close to him, and then he dodged
out of the way, and the buffalo, who was
going at full speed, leaped over the precipice,
and was dashed to pieces. Well, I thought
whether I couldn't do something of that kind.
I knew that, if I shouldn't fight, the pirates
would be as good as their word, and kill me,
and if I did, I should be guilty of piracy, and
be liable to be hung as a pirate, if ever I got
caught."</p>

<p>"That was a pretty hard choice," said
Charlie.</p>

<p>"So it seemed to me," said Bill. "The
only thing I thought of that would do me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
any good, was to turn upon the pirates some
way. If I could only have jumped into the
water, unobserved, and swam to the other
ship, I would have fought to the last, in their
defence."</p>

<p>"Why didn't you do it?"</p>

<p>"Well, my lad, there were two objections.
In the first place, the pirates would have
seen what I was at, and fired at me in the
water. In the second place, the sailors on
board the Sally Ann, thinking that I was a
pirate, would have suspected I was up to
some mischief, and so, most likely, they would
have blazed away at me, too. So, between
the two fires, I shouldn't have stood a very
good chance."</p>

<p>"I don't know but you are right."</p>

<p>"No, my lad, it didn't take me very long
to decide that there was nothing to be gained
in this way. At that moment, I chanced to
go down below for something, when my eye
rested on&mdash;what do you think?"</p>

<p>"What was it?"</p>

<p>"<i>It was a keg of powder</i>," said Bill, shaking
the ashes from his pipe. "Perhaps, my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
lad, you can guess what thought that put me
up to."</p>

<p>"Was it to blow them all up?" asked
Charlie, in excitement.</p>

<p>"You've hit it, my lad."</p>

<p>"But that would be dangerous to you."</p>

<p>"I knew that well enough," said the sailor.
"There was precious little chance of old Bill
Sturdy living to tell the story; but, my
lad, I'll tell you what made me overlook
that. I must either turn pirate and always
remain so, with a pretty considerable chance
of swinging from the gallows some time, or
else be butchered by the pirates for refusing
to join them. So, as there didn't seem to be
much but death in prospect, that consideration
didn't weigh much. Then I thought
that, if I did die by the explosion, I should
have the satisfaction of knowing that the rascally
pirates would share my fate, and the
Red Rover, the scourge of the seas, would
never do any more harm. Besides that, I
should save the Sally Ann, and the lives of
the captain and crew, and that was something
glorious to think of."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span></p>

<p>The boy's cheek glowed with sympathetic
ardor, and he clasped Bill Sturdy's rough
hand, in token of understanding and appreciating
his motive.</p>

<p>"That seemed the only way open to me,"
resumed Bill, "and I determined to adopt it.
Of course, there were nine chances out of ten
that I should be blown up with the rest of
them, but still there was a possibility of escape.
I couldn't help thinking of that, and
the more I thought, the more I had a kind of
feeling that I should escape. I thought I
would go up on deck a minute, before carrying
out my design, and see what was going
on. Well, the pirates had about got ready
for action. The decks had been cleared, the
cutlasses and pistols and other murderous
weapons had been distributed among the men,
and, altogether, there seemed precious little
chance for the poor fellows on board the Sally
Ann, especially, as I knew well enough that
they had no cannon, and only a few pistols,
that were not likely to do them much good.
There wasn't much time to lose, as the action
was going to commence. So I slipped down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
below, and fixed a slow match, so that it
would reach the powder in about a minute.
I had just about got it fixed, when who should
I see coming down, but the pirate captain.
It seemed as if all my plans were going to be
knocked in the head. No doubt he suspected
that all was not as it should be, and was
coming down to see what was to pay. I felt
desperate, and fetched him as powerful a
blow as I was able, on the side of his head,
and he fell like an ox, pretty effectually
stunned."</p>

<p>"What next?"</p>

<p>"The next thing I did was to hurry upon
deck. 'Where's the captain?' asked the
mate. 'He'll be up directly,' said I. And
so he was, but not in the sense that he understood
it.</p>

<p>"Well, I listened on deck for about half a
minute, in a terrible state of anxiety, you
may be sure. Then, feeling that it was not
safe for me to stay any longer, I jumped into
the water, and began to swim towards the
Sally Ann. As my head rose above the
water, I saw the mate about to fire at me,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
and I dove. When my head was fairly out
of water again, such a sound as smote upon
my ear! The light had reached the powder,
and there was a terrible explosion. The ship
was shattered to pieces. The pirates were
hurled into the air, some with mutilated
limbs, and I rather think that some of them
were considerably astonished. The captain
did go up as I promised. He was flung a
hundred feet into the air, and never came
down again alive. For my part, I was lucky
enough to reach the Sally Ann, untouched
by the falling fragments. When they found
out who I was, and how I had saved them,
their gratitude knew no bounds. The owners
made up a purse of two thousand dollars,
and presented it to me."</p>

<p>"And what did you do with it?"</p>

<p>"When I got back to Boston, I put it in
one of the places you call Savings Banks, and
I expect it's there now."</p>

<h2>XXIII.<br /> <small>ANTONIO'S PLOT.</small></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Such</span> is a specimen of the yarns&mdash;sometimes
true, sometimes spun out of whole cloth&mdash;with
which the sailors amused themselves
and beguiled the tedium of the night-watch.</p>

<p>The companionship of honest and stout-hearted
Bill Sturdy proved a great source of
happiness to Charlie, and enabled him to
bear up, as otherwise he might have found it
difficult to do, under the hardships of his condition,
the persecution of the captain and the
mate, who had not forgotten their animosity,
and the uncertainty he could not but feel as
to the situation in which his mother was left,
with the painful doubt as to whether she
would be able to support herself till he could
return and relieve her necessities.</p>

<p>"When we get back, my lad," said Bill
Sturdy, "I'll put half that money in the Savings
Bank in your name, so that if you and
your mother want it at any time, you can
use it."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span></p>

<p>"No, Bill," said Charlie, earnestly, "you
are very kind, but I couldn't consent to that."</p>

<p>"And why not, my lad? What do I want
of it? I've got neither chick nor child, and
am not likely to have. I've taken a fancy to
you, and the money'll do you more good than
me."</p>

<p>"You are <i>very</i> kind," said Charlie, gratefully;
"but I mustn't take advantage of your
generosity."</p>

<p>"Nonsense, my lad. I know what it is to
be a poor boy, without money or friends, and
nowadays money will bring friends. Mayhap
it'll start you in some business, and when
you get rich you can pay me; or if, by and
by, I take a notion to come to anchor on
shore, you'll give me a corner in your house,
where I can smoke my pipe and spin my
yarns."</p>

<p>"That I will, Bill," said Charlie, seizing
the old sailor's rough hand. "If I have a
roof to cover me, it shall cover you too."</p>

<p>"Thank you, my lad," said Bill. "I know
you would."</p>

<p>Under Bill Sturdy's rough exterior there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
was a kind heart which warmed to our young
hero, partly because of his solitary position
on board, partly on account of his manliness
and attractive qualities. So they became fast
friends.</p>

<p>Charlie did not find his duties altogether
distasteful. He was a bright, active boy, not
without ambition, and resolved to do himself
credit in his new position, however it may
have been forced upon him. For this reason
it was that the captain and the mate, although
they watched him with lynx eyes, hoping
that he would afford them some pretext for
showing their rancorous feelings towards
him, watched ineffectually. By his activity,
and his frank and manly disposition, he was
fast ingratiating himself with the crew, who
were the more disposed to espouse his cause,
because they could not fail to notice the injustice
with which the officers treated him.</p>

<p>But trouble was brewing for Charlie, and
soon the storm broke forth.</p>

<p>The scuffle between Bill Sturdy and Antonio,
of which Charlie was the occasion, will
not have been forgotten. Antonio had before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
hated Bill on account of his superiority in
strength, which deprived him of his former
champion's life. This feeling was increased
by the issue of the contest which had resulted
in his humiliation and defeat, and his anger
was also stirred up against Charlie, who had
been the occasion of it. Yet he did not dare
to venture upon abuse, because it was generally
understood that Bill Sturdy had constituted
himself Charlie's especial friend and
protector.</p>

<p>But there were other ways of compassing
his end. Antonio was subtile. He felt that
his revenge must be a more secret one, and
he desired that it should involve both Bill
Sturdy and his <i>protg</i>. If he could only involve
Charlie in some offence which would
draw upon him the active displeasure of the
captain, and subject him to public punishment,
he felt sure that Bill Sturdy would not
stand tamely by and see it inflicted, while
any interference would be insubordination,
and get his rival into serious trouble.</p>

<p>After reflection Antonio decided to implicate
Charlie in a charge of theft. It happened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
that the captain had a valuable gold
ring, set with diamonds, which, for reasons
unnecessary to state, he prized even beyond its
pecuniary value. Captain Brace, however,
was not a careful man. He would sometimes
take off his ring, and lay it down on
the cabin table. On one occasion Antonio,
while upon deck, observed the captain pass,
and ascertained by a swift glance that the
ring was not upon his finger. He watched
his opportunity, and slipping down into the
cabin, found, as he anticipated, the ring upon
the table. It was the work of a moment to
snatch and conceal it in his pocket.</p>

<p>He returned to the work in which he had
been engaged, and resumed it, supposing he
had not been observed.</p>

<p>In this he was mistaken.</p>

<p>Bill Sturdy had had his eye upon him from
the time of his difficulty with him. He could
see Antonio's craftiness in his face, and the
apparent affability and conciliatory manner
of the latter afterwards had by no means deceived
him.</p>

<p>"Look out for squalls," thought he. "He's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
too fair seeming to be trusted. I've no doubt
he's hatching up something or other. I'll
keep a sharp lookout for him."</p>

<p>When Antonio made his stealthy visit to the
cabin, as above described, the vigilant eye of
Bill Sturdy was upon him and his movements.</p>

<p>In a moment he reappeared. Bill saw it
all out of the corner of his eye, though he appeared
to be looking in just the opposite
direction.</p>

<p>"What's the fellow up to?" he thought.
"Some mischief, I reckon. What business
has he in the cabin? I must watch him."</p>

<p>Of course, Antonio's object will be understood.
He meant to place the ring in Charlie's
chest, and when the loss should be discovered
by the captain, he would suggest that a general
search should be instituted, the result of
which must involve our young hero.</p>

<p>Charlie was, of course, quite unconscious
of the machinations which were being formed
against him, and even Bill was not yet quite
certain for what purpose Antonio had made
his visit to the cabin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span></p>

<p>Antonio felt the necessity of doing quickly
what he had in contemplation.</p>

<p>Going below, he made his way to the chest
belonging to our hero, and, lifting the cover,
for it was unlocked, let the ring drop into one
corner.</p>

<p>Bill Sturdy saw his second disappearance
from the deck. He could not ascertain precisely
what he was doing, without following
him,&mdash;a thing which he did not wish to do,
since it would arouse Antonio's suspicions,
and place him on his guard.</p>

<p>Antonio came up with an expression of
malicious satisfaction, which Bill did not fail
to notice.</p>

<p>"I wish," he thought, "I knew exactly
what the fellow has been doing."</p>

<p>Bill was destined to learn ere long.</p>

<p>The captain went below, and glanced carelessly
at the place where he remembered to
have left the ring. To his surprise, it had
disappeared.</p>

<p>"What can have become of it?" he thought.</p>

<p>He instituted a careful examination, but
did not succeed in finding the lost article.</p>

<p>He prized it beyond its actual value, which
was considerable, and began to feel alarmed.
It occurred to him that he might have been
mistaken about leaving it on the table. It
might possibly have been dropped upon deck.</p>

<p>Going on deck, he communicated his loss
to the crew and requested a general search.</p>

<p>"I think, Captain Brace," said Antonio,
officiously, "that I can guess where it is."</p>

<p>"Where?"</p>

<p>"I saw that boy have it," pointing to
Charlie.</p>

<p>"It's a lie!" exclaimed Charlie, surprised
and indignant.</p>

<p>"We'll see about that," said the captain,
with a sneer. "Do you know what he did
with it, Antonio?"</p>

<p>"I think he may have hidden it in his
chest."</p>

<p>"Let his chest be brought on deck, and
publicly examined. If he is found guilty, he
shall be punished, as sure as my name is
Brace."</p>

<h2>XXIV.<br /> <small>CHARLIE GETS INTO TROUBLE.</small></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlie</span>, at first taken by surprise when the
charge of theft was brought against him, now
looked scornfully indignant. Ignorant of the
ways of the world, and the wickedness of
which some men are capable, he never, for a
moment, feared the result of the investigation.
As for the crew, they had already become
interested in his favor, and now pitied
him for the unfortunate position in which he
found himself placed. None of them believed
him guilty.</p>

<p>As the captain had directed, his chest was
brought on deck.</p>

<p>Before this was searched, however, he was
subjected to a personal examination, at which
nothing was discovered. There was a
murmur of satisfaction.</p>

<p>"The lad never stole the ring," said a stout
seaman, standing next to the real perpetrator
of the crime, Antonio.</p>

<p>"Don't be too sure of that," said the Spaniard,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
in a malignant tone. "His chest hasn't
been searched yet."</p>

<p>"I don't care for that; I can tell by his
face. A lad, with such a figure-head as
that, wouldn't do anything mean or dishonorable."</p>

<p>"You seem to have taken a great fancy to
him," sneered Antonio. "You mustn't trust
too much to appearances. He looks to me as
if he were guilty."</p>

<p>Charlie's cheeks were flushed, but not with
shame or confusion. It was indignation, that
he should be suspected of such a disgraceful
crime.</p>

<p>By his side stood Bill Sturdy, who took
an opportunity of whispering into his ear,
"Never you mind, my lad, even if the ring is
found in your chest."</p>

<p>"But it isn't there," said Charlie.</p>

<p>"It may be," said Bill, who, by this time,
suspected the nature of Antonio's two errands
below.</p>

<p>"How should it be there?" asked Charlie
quite in the dark.</p>

<p>"It might have been put there, my lad."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span></p>

<p>"But who could put it there?" persisted
our hero, but little enlightened.</p>

<p>"Hark you, my lad," said Bill, still farther
lowering his tones; "you've got more than one
enemy on board this ship."</p>

<p>"The mate?"</p>

<p>"Yes, and the captain too, for that matter."</p>

<p>"But neither of them would put the ring
in my chest."</p>

<p>"No, probably not."</p>

<p>"Then who would?"</p>

<p>"There is another enemy besides these
two."</p>

<p>"Do you mean Antonio?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"But he seemed friendly lately."</p>

<p>"He isn't to be trusted, my lad. He's borne
a grudge against both of us ever since I
got the better of him the other day, and he's
made up his mind to be revenged. I've been
watching him when he didn't suspect it, and
know more than he thinks I do."</p>

<p>"Do you know anything of this affair,
Bill?" asked Charlie, looking up hopefully
into the face of his friend.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span></p>

<p>"I expect I do."</p>

<p>"What is it?" questioned our hero, eagerly.</p>

<p>"I shall save it till it will do some good.
But see, they have nearly finished searching
your chest. Perhaps the ring is not there
after all."</p>

<p>As Bill said, the search was nearly completed.
Charlie's clothes had been unceremoniously
tumbled out upon deck, which was
not calculated to improve their appearance,
and the captain and mate, who had shown
themselves particularly active on the occasion,
were peering about in search of the lost
ring.</p>

<p>It chanced, however, that the ring had got
in a fold of one of the shirts which lay upon
deck. Of course, therefore, the search in the
chest proved unavailing.</p>

<p>"I doubt whether it is here," said the captain,
in a tone of disappointment.</p>

<p>"Let us look a little longer," said the mate,
who could not so easily resign the chance of
getting into trouble the boy whom he hated
with a malevolence such as his nature was capable
of.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span></p>

<p>Antonio became alarmed at the prospect of
all his plans being frustrated by a failure to
find the ring.</p>

<p>When the mate also gave up the search, he
came forward, and, addressing the captain,
said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Captain Brace, if you will let me assist in
the search, perhaps I can succeed in finding
it."</p>

<p>"You are the one that saw the boy have
it, are you?" queried the captain.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"How long since?"</p>

<p>"About half an hour."</p>

<p>"Why did you not mention it at the time?"</p>

<p>"I thought perhaps he had only picked it
up, and would give it back to you," said the
Spaniard, in some confusion. "I didn't want
to charge him with the theft till I felt sure
he meant to steal it."</p>

<p>"And what makes you feel sure he did so
intend?"</p>

<p>"Because when you said the ring was lost,
he did not come forward and restore it."</p>

<p>"Ay," said Captain Brace, "that is strongly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
against him. If it is found that he has concealed
it anywhere, he shall repent it, by&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>It is unnecessary to stain our pages by
printing the oath with which he emphasized
this assertion.</p>

<p>"What reason have you for supposing that
he concealed it in his chest?" asked the
mate.</p>

<p>"Because I saw him go down below," answered
Antonio, with unblushing falsehood.</p>

<p>"It's a lie," said Charlie, boldly. "I haven't
been below this morning."</p>

<p>"Silence!" thundered the captain, scowling
menacingly; "don't add falsehood to theft."</p>

<p>"I haven't been guilty of theft," said
Charlie boldly.</p>

<p>"Silence!" again thundered the captain,
"or it will be the worse for you."</p>

<p>"You had better not say anything more,
my lad," whispered Bill Sturdy; "we shall
yet bring you off with flying colors. Don't
you fear. Bill Sturdy is your friend, and he
will stand by you."</p>

<p>Charlie looked grateful.</p>

<p>When his statement had been so unequivocably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
denied by our hero, Antonio suffered
himself to look at him for one instant,
but in that brief glance was concentrated
so much of spite and venom and malice,
that the boy could not help shuddering, as if
the countenance of a fiend had been unexpectedly
revealed to him.</p>

<p>"I think, Captain Brace," said Randall,
"that we may venture to let Antonio assist
us, since he may succeed where we have
failed."</p>

<p>"Very well," said the captain, "I have no
objection to offer. On the contrary, if he
succeeds in finding it, I will take care that he
shall be rewarded."</p>

<p>Antonio was already on his knees before
the chest. There was a murmur of disapprobation
among the crew. They were in favor
of fair play, and this undue eagerness to convict
our hero of guilt did not commend itself
to their sense of justice and generosity. But
Antonio cared little for the sensation which
his conduct might excite among his fellow-seamen.
He cared more for the gratification
of his revenge than for personal popularity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span></p>

<p>A glance satisfied him that the ring was
not in the chest. He next began to examine
carefully the clothes which had been taken
out and were lying on deck.</p>

<p>In lifting and shaking a shirt the ring
rolled out.</p>

<p>"<i>There is your ring</i>, Captain Brace," said
he, in a tone of exultation, as he picked it up
and extended it to the captain.</p>

<hr class="chap" />
</div>



<div class="chapter">
<h2>XXV.<br /> <small>THE REAL CULPRIT IS DISCOVERED.</small></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> discovery of the ring made a profound
impression upon all present. The sailors
looked at first surprised, and then sorrowful,
for they could not escape the conviction that
Charlie had been tempted by the richness of
the prize and had actually stolen it.</p>

<p>Charlie was overwhelmed with astonishment
and indignation, and the thought that
he was considered guilty made him feel very
uncomfortable.</p>

<p>The captain, the mate, and Antonio could
hardly conceal the satisfaction which this discovery<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
afforded them. Each had motives of
his own, the captain being, of course, glad to
recover an article which he valued, but of the
three perhaps there was none that felt a more
malicious satisfaction than the one who had
devised the plot. He glanced exultantly at
Charlie and Bill Sturdy, who he knew would
be equally affected by his favorite's misfortune.</p>

<p>Bill Sturdy returned his glance composedly.
Antonio was disappointed to find that
he neither looked disturbed nor frightened.
Bill waited calmly the course of events.</p>

<p>Captain Brace exclaimed in his harsh voice,
"It seems we have a thief on board. We'll
soon teach him the way all such rascals will
be treated on board this ship. Boy, take off
your jacket."</p>

<p>"Captain Brace," said Charlie, with glowing
cheeks, and in a tone that might have
convinced any one not prejudiced against him,
"just hear what I am going to say. I didn't
steal your ring, indeed I didn't. I would
scorn to do such a thing. Ever since I could
speak my mother has taught me how mean a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
thing it is to take what belongs to another.
I own that appearances are against me."</p>

<p>Here Randall stepped forward with an evil
smile upon his face.</p>

<p>"Captain Brace, as I am the uncle of this
boy, perhaps you will allow me to tell you
how much dependence can be placed upon
his word. He is an artful young rascal. I
am sorry to say it, since he is related to
me, but the fact is, he was on the point of
being arrested for theft just before we sailed,
when I, to protect him from imprisonment,
and snatch him from the custody of the law,
took him to sea with me. I have said this
against my will, because, although I know
you, Captain Brace, would not be imposed
upon by his story, I thought there might be
others that would."</p>

<p>The sailors looked at each other, not knowing
what to think, while the captain exclaimed,
sternly, "So this is not the first of your tricks,
my fine fellow. You shall have justice done
you on the sea, if not on the land. Strip, I
tell you."</p>

<p>Charlie was so thunderstruck by Randall's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
bold falsehood that he actually had nothing
to say. He mechanically began to take off
his jacket.</p>

<p>At this moment the clarion voice of Bill
Sturdy was heard, as, hitching up his trousers
a bit, he left the mast against which he
had been leaning, and advanced into the midst
of the assembled sailors.</p>

<p>"Captain Brace," he said, in a tone firm
but respectful, "if you'll allow me, I'll tell
you what I know of this affair."</p>

<p>"So you know something about it, do you?"</p>

<p>"I thought so," said Randall, in a low voice,
for he had disliked Bill from the first.</p>

<p>"I do," was the composed reply, "but I
have no reason to be ashamed of what I do
know."</p>

<p>"I think," said the mate, "we already
know all that we require, since we have discovered
the thief."</p>

<p>He was apprehensive, from Bill's tone, that
what he had to say might put a different face
on the matter, and perhaps clear Charlie.</p>

<p>Captain Brace, however, did not choose to
be guided by the implied advice of his first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
officer. He had a curiosity to learn what
Sturdy had to communicate.</p>

<p>"Say on; what do you know of this affair?"</p>

<p>"Very well, sir. About an hour ago you
came up from the cabin and began to pace
the deck."</p>

<p>The captain assented.</p>

<p>"As you passed I observed one of the crew
take a hasty glance at your finger. I looked
also, and saw that you were not wearing your
ring as usual."</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"The sailor that I mentioned just now."</p>

<p>"Who was he?"</p>

<p>"I would rather not mention his name just
at present, unless you insist upon it."</p>

<p>The captain did not insist, and Sturdy
proceeded.</p>

<p>"I thought I would just keep my eyes
open, and see what followed. Pretty soon
the sailor I spoke of looked about him to see
if he was unnoticed, and crept slyly down
below. A little later he came up and went
to work again."</p>

<p>"Was that all?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span></p>

<p>"It was not," answered Sturdy. "He kept
at work about ten minutes longer, and then
stole towards the forecastle with the same
secrecy as before. I should have followed
him down, but I thought he would notice me.
My mind misgave me that he was in some
mischief. I determined I would remember
what happened, and if anything turned up, I
should know how it came about."</p>

<p>"And what do you make of all this?" said
Randall, sneering. "To my mind it is a foolish
story, and, even if true, amounts to
nothing."</p>

<p>"I'll tell you what I think, and am about
sure of, Mr. Randall," said Bill, without betraying
a particle of excitement, but continuing
to speak with the same calm composure
as before, "I believe that man in the first
place stole the captain's ring, and then went
and put it into the lad's chest, in order that
it might be found there, and the guilt fixed
on him."</p>

<p>This assertion made a sensation among the
crew, and there was a general feeling that
Charlie was innocent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span></p>

<p>"Who is this man of whom you have been
speaking?" said the captain.</p>

<p>"I don't need to name him," said Bill. "I
don't need even to look at him. If you will
look around you, Captain Brace, you can tell
by his looks who the man is that has hatched
this wicked plot against an innocent boy."</p>

<p>Instantly the eyes of all, as if by some
common impulse, were fixed upon the form of
Antonio, who, confused, thunderstruck by
the minute detail of his movements, which
he had supposed unnoticed by any one, now
stood with his face alternately flushing and
paling, looking the very picture of confession
and detected guilt.</p>

<p>Unable to bear the glances fixed upon him,
he exclaimed, in a voice hoarse with passion,
"It is false. I never did it."</p>

<p>"No one has accused you that I know of,"
said Bill Sturdy, coolly. "Leastways, nobody
that I know of, excepting yourself, and
your face is enough to do that. However, I
don't mind saying that you are the man I
mean. If Captain Brace will take the trouble
to remember, you are the first one that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
thought of searching for the ring, and told him
falsely that you had seen it in the hands of
that lad there. Then again, when the chest
had been searched, and the ring couldn't be
found, you came forward and offered to look
for it yourself, and finally you did find it.
That's all I've got to say, only, if you are not
the real thief I am a liar, and so is that face
of yours."</p>

<p>Carried away by his rage, Antonio, forgetting
the prudence which his past experience
might have taught him, threw himself suddenly
upon Bill Sturdy, and nearly succeeded
in laying him prostrate upon the deck.</p>

<hr class="chap" />
</div>



<div class="chapter">
<h2>XXVI.<br /> <small>A STORM BREWING.</small></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Antonio's</span> assault was so unexpected that
Bill Sturdy, being, of course, quite unprepared
for it, staggered and seemed about to
fall. But, as one who slips upon the ice
instinctively makes an effort to preserve his
equilibrium, so Sturdy immediately recovered
from the momentary disadvantage, and seizing
Antonio with both hands threw him to
the deck without any great apparent effort.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span></p>

<p>Probably if Antonio had gained the advantage,
Captain Brace would have been in no
haste to put a stop to the conflict. As it
was, his brows knit with anger as he exclaimed,
in a stentorian voice,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Stop this fighting, you lubbers! Don't
you know better the respect which is due to
my presence, you&mdash;rascals! I'll let you know
that I am not to be insulted on my own
deck."</p>

<p>"It wasn't a fight of my seeking, Captain
Brace," said Bill, coolly. "I ain't disposed to
be quarrelsome, and I guess he won't want to
try it again immediately."</p>

<p>As he said this he glanced at Antonio, who,
sorely bruised by the fall, was slowly rising
from the deck, and slinking away with a
crestfallen and malignant look. Had he not
been moved by an uncontrollable impulse of
rage and disappointment, he would scarcely
have ventured upon this open attack, knowing,
as had been incontestably proved, that he
was no match for the Herculean strength of
Bill Sturdy.</p>

<p>"Silence!" roared the captain, in answer to
Bill's vindication of himself. "One would
think from your manner that you were the
captain of this ship instead of me."</p>

<p>"If I were the captain," said Bill, bluntly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
"I'd have that man," pointing to Antonio,
"put ashore at the first port. I wouldn't
harbor such a rascal aboard the ship."</p>

<p>"Silence!" again thundered the captain.
"Don't you know your place? If you don't,
by all the saints in the calendar, I'll make
you know it before twenty-four hours have
passed over your head. Let me tell you that
I don't require any help in commanding this
vessel. When I do, I will call on you. Till
then, you may keep your advice to yourself."</p>

<p>Bill shrugged his shoulders, but thought it
prudent, on the whole, to say nothing. Not
that he feared for himself. He had a good
deal of confidence in the strength with which
nature had endowed him, but he feared that
any unguarded words of his might incite the
captain and mate to visit new hardships upon
his young <i>protg</i>, Charlie.</p>

<p>"As to the matter of the ring," said the
captain, "my mind is not made up. Mr.
Randall, will you attend me?"</p>

<p>The mate went below with Captain Brace.</p>

<p>After a moment's silence the captain said,
"I don't like that fellow, Mr. Randall."</p>

<p>"Do you mean Antonio?"</p>

<p>"No; this Sturdy, who takes such airs
upon himself."</p>

<p>"Neither do I," answered Randall, promptly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span></p>

<p>"He's a mutinous rebel. I can see it in his
eye," pursued the captain.</p>

<p>"I have no doubt he would be if he had a
good opportunity."</p>

<p>"Perhaps I shall give him one," said the
captain, significantly.</p>

<p>"He's as strong as a bull," said the mate.</p>

<p>"Yes; the fellow has fists like sledge-hammers,
but he may use them once too often.
We will speak of that hereafter. Now what
do you think of this robbery?"</p>

<p>"I suppose Antonio was the thief," said
Randall, reluctantly.</p>

<p>"You think Sturdy's story is correct?"</p>

<p>"Yes; Antonio is a deep rascal, though of
the two I hate Sturdy most."</p>

<p>"Did you suppose your nephew to be the
thief before the latter told his story?"</p>

<p>"I did not."</p>

<p>"Yet you countenanced the charge."</p>

<p>"Because I thought a flogging would do
the boy no harm."</p>

<p>"You don't seem to have any great affection
for your nephew."</p>

<p>"I do not."</p>

<p>"And the reason?"</p>

<p>"Is simply this. The boy's mother jilted
me, or rather refused me outright when I offered
my hand in marriage."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ha, that's where the shoe pinches."</p>

<p>"You are right."</p>

<p>"Well, I don't care to interfere with any
little private revenge you may desire to take,
as long as it chimes in with my own purposes.
The boy shall be flogged if you wish it."</p>

<p>"I do."</p>

<p>"Find some pretext then, as long as the
charge of robbery won't serve."</p>

<p>"Then," said Randall, "you might announce
that, although the charge of theft had
not been sustained, he had been guilty of an
offence that called for punishment&mdash;insolence
to his officers."</p>

<p>"That is a good idea. And in regard to
Antonio&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I have no doubt the rascal stole the ring,
and deserves punishment, but I don't want
him flogged, as it would gratify Sturdy too
much."</p>

<p>"My own feeling."</p>

<p>"You can say that you have been unable
to determine who is guilty in the matter, and
shall wait for further evidence."</p>

<p>"Very well conceived, Mr. Randall. I
shall follow your advice, and thank you
for it."</p>

<p>"I am glad to have been of service to you,
Captain Brace."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span></p>

<p>"And now, Mr. Randall, if you will go on
deck, I will be up presently."</p>

<p>The mate reappeared on deck with a satisfied
air, occasionally looking with a glance of
triumphant spite at Charlie, who was standing
beside his tried and trusty friend, Bill
Sturdy.</p>

<p>"You don't know what's in store for you,
my lad," he muttered. "Pity his mother
could not be here to see his fair flesh quivering
under the keen lash. Her heart would
feel every stroke. She might repent then,
the scorn with which she repelled the suit of
John Randall. How I hate that boy! He
brings up his father before me. So much the
better. When he shrinks beneath the lash, I
shall think it is my old rival upon whom it
is falling."</p>

<p>Bill Sturdy, meanwhile, said in a low voice
to Charlie, "I don't like the looks of the mate
this morning. He's hatching mischief of
some kind, if I'm not greatly mistaken."</p>

<p>"Against us?"</p>

<p>"That's what I mistrust, my lad; against
one or both of us. He hates us both, and I
ain't quite sure which he hates the most."</p>

<p>"And yet I never did him any injury."</p>

<p>"Then he's done you some harm, depend
upon it. People hate worst those they have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
injured most, and he's done you a great wrong
in stealing you from home."</p>

<p>"What do you suppose made him do that,
Bill?"</p>

<p>"He had some private reason; there ain't
a question about that. It wasn't because
we were in want of a boy. We might have
picked up plenty that would have been glad
to come."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid you'll get into trouble with
him for taking my part," said Charlie, with
some anxiety.</p>

<p>"Don't trouble yourself about me," said
Sturdy, shrugging his shoulders. "I ain't in
any way frightened by his black looks, and
if he tries to do you any mischief, he'll find
you've got one friend."</p>

<p>Before Charlie had an opportunity to reply,
Captain Brace came on deck, and looked
around him with a glance that showed a
storm was brewing.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter">
<h2>XXVII.<br /> <small>THE LASH.</small></h2>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Pipe</span> all hands to see punishment inflicted,"
ordered Captain Brace.</p>

<p>Charlie and Bill Sturdy looked at each
other, uncertain where the blow was to fall.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span></p>

<p>"It must be Antonio," thought our hero.</p>

<p>Evidently Antonio was of the same opinion,
for over his swarthy face there stole a pallor
which showed his apprehension.</p>

<p>Such was the understanding of the crew
also, as they could think of no other wrongdoer.
Little pity was excited in behalf of the
supposed sufferer. He had so abused his
position when champion of the crew, that he
had forfeited the good-will of all; and even
if this had not been the case, his treacherous
and mean attempt to bring Charlie into
trouble would have been sufficient to bring
him into disfavor.</p>

<p>The uncertainty as to the victim was dissipated
by the captain's next words.</p>

<p>"Jack Randall, come here!"</p>

<p>Charlie came forward.</p>

<p>"Boy," said Captain Brace, sternly, "you
were guilty of insolence to me this morning.
This shall never go unpunished while I am in
command of a vessel. As to the ring, you
may or may not have stolen it. It rests between
you and Antonio. As it cannot be
proved of either, neither will be punished on
this account."</p>

<p>Antonio's sallow face lighted up with joy
at this unexpected escape, a joy which was
not reflected on the faces of the crew.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span></p>

<p>"It is for insolence, therefore, and not on
account of theft," pursued the captain, "that
I sentence you, Jack Randall, to a dozen
lashes on the bare back. Off with your
jacket!"</p>

<p>Charlie was a brave boy, but the prospect
of this ignominious punishment caused his
check to pale and his voice to tremble, as he
exclaimed, "Captain Brace, if I have been
guilty of insolence or want of proper respect
to you, it was not intentional. Do not compel
me to submit to this disgraceful punishment."</p>

<p>There was a movement of sympathy among
the crew, and more than one heart softened
at the sight of Charlie's manly front, though
his lips quivered, and pride alone kept back
the tears from his eyes. Bill Sturdy started,
but checked himself, to hear what the captain
would say in response.</p>

<p>"It is too late," he said, coldly. "You
should have thought of all that before you
indulged in insolence."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It is too late, I say," roared the captain,
irritated. "Strip, you young rascal, or you
shall have some help about it, and that of a
rough kind."</p>

<p>It seemed as if all chance of escape was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
over for poor Charlie. But at that moment
Bill Sturdy pressed forward, and, hitching up
his trousers, as he was wont to do preparatory
to speaking, said, in a distinct tone of voice,
"Captain Brace."</p>

<p>"Well?" said the captain. "What have
you to say?"</p>

<p>"I should like to make a proposal to you,
sir."</p>

<p>"A proposal," repeated the captain, mystified.
"What am I to understand by
that?"</p>

<p>"It's just this, Captain Brace. You're the
captain of this vessel, and you've got a right
to flog that boy, I suppose, according to the
law.</p>

<p>"Of course I have," said the captain,
fiercely. "Do you presume to question that
right?"</p>

<p>"I don't think proper to question it just
now," said Bill; "but, Captain Brace, just
look at that boy. Look at his bright, honest
face, and you can't have the heart to abuse
him."</p>

<p>"Abuse him!" exclaimed the captain,
stamping on the deck in his fury; "say that
again, and I'll have you flogged with him."</p>

<p>"It was something of that kind that I was
going to propose," said Bill Sturdy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span></p>

<p>Captain Brace stared at him in astonishment,
a feeling which was shared by the
crew.</p>

<p>"If you want to be flogged," said the captain,
grimly, "we will try to accommodate
you."</p>

<p>"It is in this way that I mean," exclaimed
Bill. "I've taken a liking to that lad, and
I've promised him I'll stand his friend. Now,
Captain Brace, if somebody must be flogged,
spare him, and flog me in his place."</p>

<p>Surprise was depicted on every face, and
the sunburnt and rough-visaged men about
him felt an involuntary thrill of respect and
admiration, as Sturdy manfully came forward
and offered his own back to the punishment,
which is properly regarded as an insult to
manhood, though the disgrace attaches not to
the one who endures, but to the one who inflicts
it.</p>

<p>Charlie was the first to speak. His generous
heart revolted at the idea of escaping punishment
at the expense of his friend.</p>

<p>"No, Bill Sturdy," said he, manfully, "I
don't want you to suffer in my place. It'll
be hard to bear it," and his lip quivered;
"but it would be weak and cowardly for me
to let anybody else suffer in my place."</p>

<p>Charlie began to take off his jacket.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span></p>

<p>There was a murmuring among the crew,
testifying to the excitement which they felt.</p>

<p>"Put on your jacket, my lad," said Bill.
"I'm older and tougher than you, and I can
bear it better."</p>

<p>And the stout seaman pulled off his shirt,
and displayed his brawny shoulders, and a
chest whose breadth and depth betokened a
strength which could not be styled less than
Herculean.</p>

<p>Antonio looked on, his eye blazing with
vindictive joy. Whichever was flogged, his
satisfaction would be equal.</p>

<p>"Hark you!" exclaimed Captain Brace,
interfering at this juncture. "I think that I
shall choose to have a voice in this matter.
So you wish," turning to Sturdy, "to relieve
this boy of his punishment, do you?"</p>

<p>"I do," said the old seaman.</p>

<p>"I don't want him to," interrupted Charlie.
"It is mine, and I will bear it."</p>

<p>"It seems the parties are not agreed," said
the captain, sardonically.</p>

<p>"Spare him," said Bill Sturdy, his eyes
resting affectionately on Charlie. "He is so
young."</p>

<p>"Perhaps the best way in which I can
please you both is to divide the punishment
between you. I had sentenced this lad to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
receive twelve lashes. Since you wish to do
him a service, you shall receive six, and he
the other six."</p>

<p>"I do not consent," said Sturdy, comprehending
the captain's purpose to humiliate
both. "If his back is to receive a single lash,
my offer will not save him from the disgrace,
and that is worse than the pain."</p>

<p>At this juncture the mate whispered something
in the captain's ear.</p>

<p>The face of the latter lighted up with
satisfaction, and his next words revealed the
nature of the mate's suggestion.</p>

<p>"I consent to the substitution," he said, and
then paused.</p>

<p>Bill Sturdy's face glowed with generous
satisfaction, and with heroic forgetfulness of
self, he began to strip for punishment.</p>

<p>A moment, and his back, broad and ample,
was bared and the thick, corded muscles
could be seen.</p>

<p>"Antonio, come forward," said Captain
Brace.</p>

<p>Antonio advanced amid the general surprise
of the crew, and somewhat to his own,
and stood still, awaiting orders.</p>

<p>"Now," said Captain Brace, his tone showing
his malignant satisfaction. "I appoint
you as my deputy to administer twelve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
lashes to this man; mind that you don't
spare him."</p>

<p>Antonio did not need this injunction. His
eyes were full of fiendish triumph, as he seized
the instrument of torture, and flourished it
above his head.</p>

<p>As for Bill Sturdy, when he knew that
Antonio was to be employed to inflict punishment
upon him, this refinement of torture
shook his resolution for a moment. It was,
indeed, the bitterest drop in the cup. But
not for an instant did his resolution falter.
He would save Charlie at all hazards. He
quickly recovered himself, and said, in a firm
voice, "I am ready."</p>

<p>Instantly the lash was whirled aloft, and
buried itself in his flesh.</p>

<p>There was a quiver, and that was all.</p>

<p>One&mdash;two&mdash;three&mdash;four&mdash;</p>

<p>In fast succession the blows fall upon
his flesh, he meanwhile standing firmly
braced, though his cheek was paler than
its wont.</p>

<p>Charlie's heart sickened, and he closed his
eyes to shut out the fearful spectacle.</p>

<p>As for Antonio, he seemed to revel in the
task which had been assigned him. His eyes
fairly danced with baleful light, and he seemed
almost beside himself. It was this, perhaps,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
that led him to exceed by one the strokes
which he had been ordered to administer.</p>

<p>A moment after, and the lash was wrested
from him by Bill Sturdy, who threw him to
the deck, with one powerful grasp tore the
covering from his back, and buried the lash
which had scarred his own back in the flesh
of his late executioner who with face distorted
with fright and pain roared for mercy.</p>

<p>"That is to pay for the blow you struck
on your own account, you scoundrel," exclaimed
Sturdy. "And now," as the lash
descended once more with prodigious force,
and the victim fairly writhed under it, "you
are one in my debt."</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>XXVIII.<br /> <small>TWO CONFERENCES.</small></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">So</span> strongly were the sympathies of the
crew with Sturdy, more especially since he
had shown himself capable of such disinterested
and heroic self-sacrifice, and so decidedly
were their feelings enlisted against Antonio,
who acted like a fiend rather than a man in
the execution of the welcome duty assigned
him by the captain, that this sudden turning
of the tables, the summary revenge taken by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
Bill Sturdy in return for the additional blow
Antonio had inflicted, was greeted with a
triumphant shout from the sailors, which
seemed to spring from them spontaneously.</p>

<p>Captain Brace bit his lip, and Randall's
face darkened with rage. They felt that the
humiliation which they had intended for Bill
Sturdy had recoiled upon the head of their
own agent.</p>

<p>The worst of it was they could not prudently
resent it. Antonio had in the eyes of all
been guilty of a glaring offence in exceeding
his orders, and had justly brought upon himself
the punishment he had received. However,
the justice or injustice of the matter
would have weighed little with Captain
Brace if he had not been assured that it
would not be safe for him to go further.
The law, at the time of which I am speaking,
gave almost unlimited power to the commander
of a vessel over the lives and liberties
of those who were placed under him, yet
most were aware that there was a point at
which it was wise to pause. At the commencement
of the scene, there had been audible
murmurs among the crew, the significance
of which the captain and mate would understand.
The habit of subordination, and the
knowledge that this was in a certain sense a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
voluntary act on the part of Bill Sturdy, had
prevented anything more, but if the captain
had gone to greater extremities, the consequences
might have been serious.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Antonio picked himself up,
smarting under the terrible wounds which
had been inflicted by the lash wielded
with the whole of Bill Sturdy's enormous
strength. Indeed, although he had received
but two stripes, and his enemy thirteen, it
may be doubted whether the pain inflicted by
those two were not equal to that of the greater
number.</p>

<p>Antonio had slunk down into the forecastle
to bathe his back and obtain fresh
clothes, for his shirt had been rent asunder.
Bill Sturdy, on the other hand, proceeded to
attire himself on deck and went about his
work, without showing outwardly the pain
which he must have been suffering.</p>

<p>Captain Brace took no public notice of the
retribution which had followed the punishment.
He didn't dare to act as he wished,
and therefore chose to pass it unnoticed.
But an hour afterwards, as he sat in conference
with the mate, his fury burst the
bounds he had imposed upon it.</p>

<p>"Curse that fellow!" he exclaimed. "Is
he forever destined to thwart my designs? I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
felt that I could willingly have flogged him
myself till the last breath left his body."</p>

<p>"It is a pity Antonio ventured to exceed
his orders."</p>

<p>"Yes, the fool was richly repaid for his
act, but I could wish it had been by a different
hand."</p>

<p>"That extra blow gave Sturdy a pretext
for his summary vengeance. But for that his
conduct could have been construed into mutiny
and disrespect to you."</p>

<p>"And then I might have put him in irons."</p>

<p>"You might do it now, but for&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But for the crew, you would say. That
alone prevents me. The fellow, unluckily,
has secured their sympathy. Would that I
could devise some way for taking vengeance
safely upon this rebellious scoundrel."</p>

<p>The mate leaned his head upon his hand,
and gave himself up to reflection. Something
occurred to him, for lifting his head again, he
asked,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Have you ever been in Rio Janeiro, Captain
Brace?"</p>

<p>"Never but once, and that some nine or
ten years since."</p>

<p>"There are desperadoes in that city, as in
others," pursued Randall, fixing his eyes intently
upon the captain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span></p>

<p>"I do not quite catch your meaning, Mr.
Randall."</p>

<p>"Men who are little troubled by conscientious
scruples, but are willing to undertake
the most dangerous and illegal enterprises&mdash;<i>for
small consideration</i>.</p>

<p>"I begin to understand you now," said the
captain.</p>

<p>"Shall I proceed?"</p>

<p>"Do so."</p>

<p>The mate rightly construed this into an intimation
that his proposition, though hinting
at crime, would not prove distasteful to the
captain. This, knowing the character of his
superior officer, did not surprise him, and he
proceeded.</p>

<p>"I think you apprehend my meaning, Captain
Brace. This man is a thorn in our sides.
He is exerting a bad influence on board the
ship. He is undermining your influence with
the crew."</p>

<p>"That is all true, Mr. Randall. What,
then, is your advice in this state of affairs?"</p>

<p>"My advice is, that this fellow <i>should be
removed</i>."</p>

<p>"To a place better fitted for him," suggested
the captain, with a grim smile.</p>

<p>"Precisely so."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span></p>

<p>"And through the agency of such men as
you have spoken of?"</p>

<p>"That is my proposition."</p>

<p>"It deserves thinking of. May I ask if
you have any acquaintance among the fraternity,
or whether you have ever had any occasion
to employ their services?"</p>

<p>"I did on one occasion."</p>

<p>"Do you mind giving the particulars?"</p>

<p>"To you, no. Some years since I shipped
as common sailor on board the Porcupine,
bound from New York to Rio. On the voyage
one of the sailors on several occasions
insulted me, and I determined upon revenge.
At Rio I fell in with a desperate character,
who for a comparatively small sum engaged
to do my bidding."</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"There is not much to tell. One night
this man was passing through a narrow street,
quite unsuspicious of danger, when he was
suddenly struck from behind by a bludgeon,
and&mdash;<i>he never came back to the ship</i>."</p>

<p>"Did no suspicion attach to you?"</p>

<p>"How should there? Who was to betray
me? Not my agent, or in so doing he would
betray himself. This is the first time I have
ever spoken of it, but I am safe with
you."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span></p>

<p>"Perfectly. You say the consideration
was small."</p>

<p>"Fifty dollars only. I dare say the fellow
considered himself well paid. Besides
he took whatever his victim had about
him."</p>

<p>"Thank you for the suggestion, Mr. Randall.
I will furnish the money, if you will
undertake the management of the business
when we reach Rio."</p>

<p>"With pleasure," replied the mate, and he
probably spoke the truth.</p>

<p>While this conversation was going on,
Charlie in another part of the vessel was commiserating
Bill Sturdy on his injuries.</p>

<p>"And it was on my account, too," said the
boy, regretfully.</p>

<p>"Better me than you, my lad," said the
old sailor stoutly. "Don't trouble yourself
about that. It was my own free will,
and if I had been unwilling all the power of
the captain couldn't have made me submit to
it. Besides there was one thing that repaid
me for it all. Antonio got something he'll
remember to the latest day of his life, I
reckon. However that ain't what I want to
say now. It's just this. I haven't any particular
inducements to stay aboard this vessel,
and I've about made up my mind to give<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
them the slip at the first port we come to, if
you'll go with me."</p>

<p>"Where do we touch first?"</p>

<p>"At Rio, I surmise."</p>

<p>"I'm ready to go with you, Bill, whenever
you say the word," said Charlie, promptly.</p>

<p>"That's right, my lad."</p>

<p>And so the agreement was made.</p>

<hr class="chap" />
</div>



<div class="chapter">
<h2>XXIX.<br /> <small>DANGER THREATENS BILL STURDY.</small></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is my intention to pass rapidly over the
time which intervened between the events
which have been described, and the arrival of
the Bouncing Betsey at Rio Janeiro. Nothing
happened of sufficient interest to call for
record.</p>

<p>As for our hero and Bill Sturdy, their position
was, unquestionably, more agreeable
and less disturbed by incidents than before.
This was not owing to any change in the feelings
of the captain and mate, but in consequence
of the iniquitous compact into which
they had entered. They felt secure of ultimate
vengeance; they could, therefore, afford
to wait. Indeed, they felt that they should
be more likely to secure the end they had in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
view if, for the present, they should so act as
to lull asleep any suspicions which might be
entertained of their agency in the affair after
it was over.</p>

<p>But Bill Sturdy was not deceived. He
determined to keep his "weather-eye open,"
as he expressed it, and be on the lookout for
squalls.</p>

<p>So the time passed.</p>

<p>It was a bright, tropical day. The thick
garments which all had worn on leaving port
were laid aside, and every one was dressed in
light and thin attire.</p>

<p>"We shall probably reach Rio to-morrow,
Mr. Randall," observed the captain.</p>

<p>"Yes; if the present wind holds, there can
be no doubt of it."</p>

<p>"And the little plan which we have been
contemplating need no longer be delayed."</p>

<p>Randall smiled acquiescence.</p>

<p>The wind held favorable, and the next
evening saw them in port.</p>

<p>The captain and mate went on shore, leaving
the vessel in charge of the second mate.</p>

<p>We have nothing to do with the motions
of the captain, but will follow Randall, who,
never backward in ill-doing, at once set about
the execution of his scheme.</p>

<p>Having been in the city before, he was well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
acquainted with localities, and therefore was
able to direct his steps at once to that quarter
where he felt he was most likely to meet the
man he was in quest of.</p>

<p>He entered a low drinking-saloon, and
ordered a glass of liquor, partly to gratify his
taste, partly that while drinking he might
have leisure to look about him.</p>

<p>It was a low, square room, dark and unsightly,
frequented evidently by the lowest
ranks only. At this time there was but one
man present besides Randall.</p>

<p>This man was tall, low-browed, with shaggy
black eyebrows, and a face on which villainy
was stamped in Nature's plainest and most
ineffaceable characters.</p>

<p>"There's a man," thought the mate, "that
will serve my turn, and, to judge from his
looks, will be troubled by no unnecessary
scruples on the subject."</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the other, lifting his eyes from
the glass, had observed his close scrutiny, and
chose to take offence at it. He rose from his
seat, and, advancing towards Randall, observed,
in a menacing tone, "It appears to me, seor,
that you are impertinent."</p>

<p>Randall understood the language in which
this was spoken, and coolly inquired, "How
so?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span></p>

<p>"You have been staring at me as if you had
some particular object in it."</p>

<p>"So I have," returned the mate, in the same
tone as before.</p>

<p>"Explain yourself, seor, and if, as I mistrust,
you mean to insult me, I will make you
better acquainted with my good knife," and
he tapped the knife significantly.</p>

<p>"It is an acquaintance which I do not
court," said Randall, shrugging his shoulders.
"But it appears to me that it is not well
talking without something to moisten the
throat. I shall be happy to have you drink
with me."</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon, seor, for my suspicions,
which, I see, were wrong. I see that
you are a gentleman. Henceforth I will treat
you as such."</p>

<p>"I thought you would learn to know me
better," said Randall, filling both glasses;
"let me drink to our better acquaintance."</p>

<p>Both sat down very amicably. The glass
had made them friends.</p>

<p>"I should like to ask your advice on a certain
point," said Randall.</p>

<p>"I will give it with pleasure."</p>

<p>"I have an enemy&mdash;a deadly foe&mdash;whom I
detest. What would you do if you were in
my place?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span></p>

<p>"You say he is your deadly foe?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"I would give him a passport to another
world. That is my advice."</p>

<p>"And you would feel no compunctions?"</p>

<p>"No more than if I were crushing a
spider."</p>

<p>"I will own, then," said Randall, "that I
have thought of this, but it is difficult for me
to act in the matter."</p>

<p>"Then hire another to do it."</p>

<p>"Ah, if I could only find some brave man
who would undertake the job."</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"I would engage him to do it for me,
if&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"If we could agree upon the terms."</p>

<p>"You need seek no further for your man,
then," said the stranger, gulping down another
glass.</p>

<p>"How is that?" asked Randall, pretending
not to understand him fully.</p>

<p>"Because, you see before you one who is
willing to undertake it."</p>

<p>"You?"</p>

<p>"And why not?"</p>

<p>"Certainly, there is no good reason."</p>

<p>"Now tell me about it."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span></p>

<p>"First, let us settle about the price to be
paid."</p>

<p>"As you please."</p>

<p>After some little discussion this was finally
fixed at sixty dollars. For this paltry sum,
added to the booty which he might find upon
the person of his victim, this miserable man
was willing to commit one of the worst of
crimes.</p>

<p>"Now," continued the mate, "I must give
you some directions which will enable you to
identify the person."</p>

<p>"Is he a sailor?"</p>

<p>"He is."</p>

<p>"On board what ship?"</p>

<p>"The Bouncing Betsey."</p>

<p>"Lying where?"</p>

<p>Randall indicated the wharf at which the
vessel was moored.</p>

<p>"Now describe the man."</p>

<p>"He is rather below the common height,
broad-shouldered, extraordinarily strong; in
fact such a Hercules that it will be well for
you to take him by surprise."</p>

<p>"This will make me equal with him," said
the Brazilian, displaying his knife.</p>

<p>"That and the darkness."</p>

<p>"When shall I be likely to meet him?"</p>

<p>"He will receive permission to come on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
shore to-morrow night," said Randall. "You
must be hovering about the vessel, and watch
the sailors as they come from the ship. When
you see him, you will follow him."</p>

<p>"Trust me for that."</p>

<p>"And when all is over, and you furnish
me evidence that you have done the deed,
the money shall be yours."</p>

<p>"I require a portion in advance. How do
I know but you will play me false?"</p>

<p>"My good friend, I should expect, in that
case, to become your victim. However, your
request is reasonable. You shall have one
third of the sum stipulated in advance."</p>

<p>He placed twenty dollars in the hands of
his companion, and, rising, paid his score. He
then betook himself to the ship, and, on the
arrival of Captain Brace, acquainted him with
the result of his visit. The latter expressed
great satisfaction.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Bill Sturdy and Charlie were
speaking of the plan they had in view,&mdash;that
of escaping from the ship.</p>

<p>"Suppose," said Charlie, "we cannot obtain
permission to go on shore together."</p>

<p>"Then I will come to the wharf at midnight,
and you can leave your bunk unobserved
and join me."</p>

<h2>XXX.<br /> <small>THE PASS OF DEATH.</small></h2>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Have</span> I permission to go on shore, Captain
Brace?" inquired Bill Sturdy on the following
morning.</p>

<p>"I shall require your services on board
during the day," said the captain, acting in
accordance with the suggestion and arrangements
of the mate. "At nightfall you can
go if you like."</p>

<p>Charlie, learning from Bill Sturdy, the
result of his application, did not prefer a request
till evening. His request was unceremoniously
refused. The Captain had no desire
that our young hero should be present at the
assault upon Bill, as his presence might prevent
the attack being made, and its success,
in consequence of Sturdy's great strength,
depended on its unexpectedness.</p>

<p>"Never mind," said Bill, in a low voice,
"wait till midnight. Meanwhile I will be
seeking out a proper place of concealment.
When the Cathedral clock strikes midnight,
rise quietly and take a bundle of clothes, if
you can do it unobserved, and jump upon
the wharf. I will be waiting for you."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span></p>

<p>Cheered by this hope, Charlie was content
to wait.</p>

<p>He went below, and opening his chest, put
together in a bundle the clothes which he had
on when he went on board the vessel for the
first time. His little preparation having now
been made, he sat down and commenced a
letter to his mother which it was his purpose
to mail in the city, to be completed when the
result of his attempt to escape should be
known.</p>

<p>We must now follow the movements of the
villain with whom Randall had conferred.
He had no idea of failing to carry out his
part of the contract. Aside from the pecuniary
inducement, his savage temper and utter
want of principle, made him rather court such
adventures, even for their own sake. Just
before nightfall he stationed himself at a point
on the wharf where he would have an opportunity
of observing all that went on board the
vessel.</p>

<p>With his keen eyes he scrutinized the forms
of the sailors with a view of verifying Randall's
description, and so picking out the one
who was destined to be his victim. Circumstances
conspired to lead him to a wrong conclusion
upon this point.</p>

<p>Bill Sturdy was, at that time, below, making<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
preparations to go on shore. It has already
been remarked, that previous to his enrolment
among the crew, Antonio had been, physically
the most powerful among them.
Although inferior to Bill Sturdy, yet he possessed
a formidable amount of strength, and
on board most vessels might have challenged
comparison with any. But if Antonio was
one in a hundred, Sturdy was one in a thousand.
Seldom, very seldom, is there concentrated
in the human frame so much power as
he possessed. He would not have been found
unequal to the feats of strength which have
made famous the name of Richard C&oelig;ur de
Lion, the English king, who won, in so remarkable
a degree, the chivalrous respect and
affection of the English people, and whose
feats still live in the pages of the greatest of
modern romances.</p>

<p>Antonio was, in form, not altogether unlike
Bill Sturdy. At all events, the resemblance
was so great that the mate's description of
Sturdy might easily be supposed to apply to
him. Hence, when the Brazilian cast a scrutinizing
glance over the persons of the crew,
he at once selected Antonio as the one
intended.</p>

<p>"That is the fellow," he muttered. "He
looks powerful, but my good knife will prevent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
his being dangerous to me, provided I
steal upon him from behind, and give him one
sharp, decisive blow."</p>

<p>Bill Sturdy was not the only one permitted
to go on shore that evening. Several others
had similar permission extended to them,
leaving behind only enough to keep the proper
watch on board the vessel.</p>

<p>A company, including Antonio, left the
vessel together some five minutes before Bill
Sturdy made his appearance. The Brazilian,
fixing his attention upon him, followed them
at a little distance, cautiously avoiding the
appearance of doing so, lest he might attract
observation. He did not expect to carry out
his design at present, partly because it was
not yet dark, and partly also because he
wished to wait till Antonio was alone. He
was resolved to keep him in view, for hours,
if need be, until a favorable opportunity
should present itself for the commission of
the crime he meditated.</p>

<p>The first place the men visited was a low
drinking saloon, situated on a street considered
hardly reputable. It was not long before
they became noisy and drunk.</p>

<p>One by one they staggered out of the drinking-saloon.
Among the last to go was Antonio.
He had probably drank more than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
any of his comrades, but he had a strong
head, and showed his potations less in his gait
than many of the rest. He walked out with
a steady step, somewhat to the disappointment
of the Brazilian, who had been keeping
vigilant guard, and relied upon the effects of
the liquor to make him an easier conquest.</p>

<p>It was already dark, but the street was too
public, and he would be too liable to interruption
and detection to make it prudent to
attack at present. He therefore cautiously
followed Antonio, hoping that he would presently
turn into some narrow lane or alley.</p>

<p>In this hope he was not disappointed. At
a little distance there was a narrow alley leading
from the street in which Antonio was now
walking to another of equal size. Antonio
stood a little doubtful at the entrance, but
finally entered. If he had only known that
there was one close upon his heels, who was
tracking him with the keenness of an Indian
upon the trail of his foeman, he might have
hesitated before entering what, to him, was
destined to prove "the pass of death."</p>

<p>But he did not know this.</p>

<p>The alley was a long one, little frequented
at that hour, and unlighted. Cautiously behind
the doomed sailor walked the hired
assassin. And now Antonio is nearly midway.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
Between them there is a distance of
fifty feet. Over this interval creeps the murderer
with noiseless feet. Then, snatching
the ever-ready knife from his girdle, he lifts
his hand, and the descending knife is buried
in the back of Antonio, entering just below
his neck. He sank to the ground with a convulsive
shudder, and a sharp cry of pain.</p>

<p>The Brazilian stood over him. Antonio
looked up into his face, supposing it might
be Bill Sturdy, whose enmity he judged by
his own.</p>

<p>And the thought came to him.</p>

<p>Half lifting himself from the ground with
his last remaining strength, he ejaculated,
feebly, "Were you hired to do this?"</p>

<p>"I was," said the assassin, briefly.</p>

<p>Antonio could have but one thought as to
the one who had instigated the murder. He
was satisfied it was Bill, and that thought
made death doubly bitter.</p>

<p>With a curse upon his lips, a bitter malediction
upon his rival, he died.</p>

<p>Quickly stripping his victim of whatever
he had about him worth taking, his murderer
crept away.</p>

<h2>XXXI.<br /> <small>CHARLIE'S ESCAPE FROM THE SHIP.</small></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Randall</span> had made an appointment to
meet his agent at midnight at the place where
they originally met.</p>

<p>Some ten minutes before the hour he entered,
and found the Brazilian seated at a
table with a bottle before him.</p>

<p>"I am here first," said the latter, nonchalantly,
as he laid down a glass which he had
drained.</p>

<p>"So it seems," said Randall. "And now,
what success?" he asked, eagerly.</p>

<p>"The best."</p>

<p>"You have&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I have earned my reward."</p>

<p>"Good!" exclaimed the mate, his eyes
flashing with revengeful malice.</p>

<p>"And now," said the assassin, coolly, "I am
ready to receive my pay."</p>

<p>"You shall have it as soon as you prove to
me that you have stated the truth."</p>

<p>"Do you dare to doubt my word?" said
the Brazilian, fiercely.</p>

<p>"Not at all."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why, then, do you demand this proof?
Have I not told you?"</p>

<p>"Because," said Randall, "you must know,
that in this matter I am the agent of another,
and that the money with which I pay you is
not mine, but only what he has intrusted to
me."</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"You will easily understand that, though
I may be perfectly satisfied with your assurance,
he is a different person. He has never
met with you, and may very reasonably require
some proof that the deed has been done."</p>

<p>"Would you know the hair of this man?"
asked the Brazilian.</p>

<p>"I should."</p>

<p>He drew from his bosom a lock of hair
which he had severed from the head of his
victim.</p>

<p>Randall looked at it eagerly, turned pale,
and uttered an exclamation of mingled surprise
and dismay.</p>

<p>"You have made a great mistake," he said.</p>

<p>"A mistake?" echoed the other.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Randall; "you must have killed
the wrong man!"</p>

<p>"What makes you think so?"</p>

<p>"Because the hair should be sandy. This
is black."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span></p>

<p>"Beware," said the assassin, suspiciously,
"how you attempt to trick me out of my
reward. The knife which has drunk the blood
of one can, on occasion, do the same thing for
another."</p>

<p>"Your suspicions are unjust," said the
mate. "In any event, you are welcome to what
you have already received, and we must enter
upon a new contract for the other."</p>

<p>"Umph!" muttered his companion, but
half appeased.</p>

<p>"And now let us go and see who has been
the victim of this unlucky mistake."</p>

<p>Together they proceed cautiously to the
alley where the sailor yet lay, cold and rigid,
his face wearing the look of dark, sullen
hatred and ferocity which had been habitual
to it in life.</p>

<p>"Good heavens!" exclaimed Randall.
"This is Antonio."</p>

<p>"Is it not the man you intended?"</p>

<p>"No; it is his deadly foe. But what a
fearful look he wears in death. Was there
any struggle?"</p>

<p>"No; he had no chance."</p>

<p>"You did not kill him instantly?"</p>

<p>"He had time to ask a question."</p>

<p>"What was it?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span></p>

<p>"He asked if I had been hired to murder
him."</p>

<p>"And you answered&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Did you tell him by whom you were
hired?"</p>

<p>"I had no opportunity. He had just
strength to ask the question, and then
died."</p>

<p>"He supposed it to be another," said Randall.
"But it can't be helped, and we may
as well leave this place, or we may incur suspicion.
I don't know that I care much for
the mistake. He was an ugly fellow."</p>

<p>"About the other?"</p>

<p>"If you will be on the wharf to-morrow
morning, I will take care that the man is on
deck. You could not fail to recognize him,
but to avoid all mistake, I will go forward
and speak to him."</p>

<p>"And am I to receive no more than twenty
dollars for what I have already done?" asked
the Brazilian, discontentedly.</p>

<p>"Did you take nothing from the corpse?"</p>

<p>The assassin had found considerable money,
and the thought of this tended to appease
him.</p>

<p>"You are welcome to that, whatever it is,
and for the new enterprise you shall have as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
much as I promised in the first place. You
see, therefore, that you will be a gainer by the
mistake that has taken place, while I shall be
out of pocket by it."</p>

<p>"You said you were but an agent."</p>

<p>"So I am, but this money will come from
me."</p>

<p>Here the two villains parted company, one
betaking himself to his ship, the other returning
to the drinking-saloon, where he spent
the remainder of the night in drunken revelry.</p>

<p>In the meantime the man against whose
life Randall had plotted unsuccessfully was
preparing another disappointment for the
mate.</p>

<p>On leaving the ship, not dreaming how important
to him had been the ten minutes by
which his comrades had preceded him, Bill
Sturdy struck for the central part of the city
by the most direct route.</p>

<p>Turning a corner, he unexpectedly fell in
with a sailor who had been a messmate on a
former voyage. Bill ascertained that his comrade
was about to sail in two days for Liverpool,
and from thence to New York.</p>

<p>"Can your captain take another hand?"
asked Sturdy.</p>

<p>"I have no doubt he would like one, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
we are short-handed. We lost a sailor overboard
just before we got into Rio."</p>

<p>"Do you carry any passengers?"</p>

<p>"A few."</p>

<p>"I shall want to secure a berth for one."</p>

<p>"You don't mean to say, Bill, that you've
been spliced?"</p>

<p>"Not quite so bad as that. The passenger
is a boy."</p>

<p>"A son of yours?"</p>

<p>"I wish he was," said Bill, earnestly; "but
I'll tell you more about this matter another
time. For the present, keep dark. And that
reminds me, can you tell me of any quiet,
decent place where the lad and I can come to
anchor?"</p>

<p>"I know of a widow woman who will give
you good rooms."</p>

<p>Bill took down the address.</p>

<p>Toward twelve o'clock he returned to the
wharf at which the vessel was lying. While
he was standing in the shadow of a large
building the cathedral clock struck twelve.</p>

<p>A moment after, and a youthful form
appeared upon deck, descended the side
swiftly, and stepped on the wharf.</p>

<p>"Here I am, my lad," said Sturdy, in a low
voice, coming out from his place of concealment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span></p>

<p>"I was afraid you wouldn't be here,"
whispered Charlie.</p>

<p>"Trust me for that. And now we must
be making sail, or the pirates will be after
us."</p>

<p>And this is the way Charlie took leave of
the Bouncing Betsey.</p>

<hr class="chap" />
</div>



<div class="chapter">
<h2>XXXII.<br /> <small>FIRST LESSONS.</small></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">We</span> will not attempt to depict the rage and
vexation of Randall and the captain when
they ascertained that Bill Sturdy had made
his escape from the vessel and taken Charlie
with him. For they entertained no doubt
from the previous intimacy of the two that
they had deserted the ship in company. They
instituted as strict a search as they were able,
and even offered a reward to any of the crew
who should be instrumental in bringing back
either, but particularly the boy. None of
the sailors, however, would have betrayed our
hero, even if they had had the opportunity.
Captain Brace was finally obliged to put to
sea without those whom he was so desirous of
getting back into his power. He was compelled
at the last to ship two new hands in
place of Bill Sturdy and Antonio.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span></p>

<p>As for Bill Sturdy, he embarked on the
Liverpool-bound vessel. He was desirous
that Charlie should go as passenger, offering
to pay his fare, that he might be spared the
hardships of a boy on board ship. But to this
arrangement our hero strongly objected. He
said he had no intention of being idle, and as
to the hardships, he was willing to encounter
them. Bill, therefore, withdrew his objections,
and Charlie became one of the crew.
He soon became a favorite, and as the captain
and mate were quite different in character and
disposition from those of the Bouncing Betsey,
his voyage proved much more pleasant and
satisfactory.</p>

<p>We must now take leave of our young hero,
well assured that he is in good hands, and,
transferring the scene to Boston, inquire into
the fate of our friends there.</p>

<p>It will be remembered that Mrs. Codman,
after the abduction of her son, was successful
in obtaining the post of governess to a rather
playful and mischievous young lady, the only
daughter of a wealthy merchant named Bowman.</p>

<p>Mrs. Codman found her pupil as playful as
a kitten, and about as fond of study. To
confess the truth, Miss Bert Bowman was
deplorably ignorant for a young lady of her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
age. Her governess, however, soon ascertained
that it was from no want of natural capacity,
but rather because she had been so much
indulged, that nothing had been required of
her beyond what the young lady chose to
perform, and that was exceedingly little. In
a private conversation with Mrs. Codman,
Mr. Bowman explained the deficiencies of
Bert with their cause, and went on to say,
"Now, my dear madam, I wish to surrender
Bert to your charge entirely. I feel assured
that I may rely upon your judgment to adopt
such a course as may be best adapted to reconcile
her to study, of which at present, she
has a great dread. I would not counsel too
great strictness at first, though I do not
apprehend that from you. Neither perhaps
ought we to try to advance very rapidly at
first. Step by step, will be the most judicious
way. In regard to hours, text-books, and
studies generally, you will do as you think
best."</p>

<p>"I thank you, Mr. Bowman," replied Mrs.
Codman, "for your dependence on my judgment,
and hope to deserve it. I hope my
young pupil, who, I am convinced is not wanting
in intelligence, will do justice to her
natural capacity."</p>

<p>The next day Mrs. Codman commenced her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
undertaking, for such it may appropriately be
called.</p>

<p>"Bertha," said she, pointing to the clock,
"it is nine o'clock. Suppose we commence
our studies."</p>

<p>"Just let me have another race with Topsy,"
said Bert, who was flying round the room
in pursuit of the black kitten, who was evidently
regarded by her young mistress as a
congenial companion.</p>

<p>"I am afraid I must say no, my dear child,"
said Mrs. Codman gently; "there is nothing
like punctuality. So if you will just ring the
bell, I will ask Jane to take away Topsy for
the present."</p>

<p>"Can't Topsy come to school with me?"
asked Bert, disappointed.</p>

<p>"I am afraid if she did my other pupil
would not make very much progress."</p>

<p>Bert unwillingly acquiesced in the dismission
of her favorite companion.</p>

<p>"You won't keep me as long as they do in
school, will you, Mrs. Codman?" asked Bert.
"If I had to study four or six hours, I should
certainly go into a fit."</p>

<p>"I dare say you would," replied her teacher,
smiling. "Therefore I sha'n't keep you so
long. In fact, as you are the only scholar, we
sha'n't bind ourselves to so many hours, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
rather to so much learned, so that it will
depend a good deal on how well you study."</p>

<p>"That's good," said Bert. "Only, Mrs.
Codman, you mustn't be too hard upon me.
I don't believe I can get very long lessons."</p>

<p>"I mean to be quite easy at first. I shall
not ask much, but that little I shall be strict
in requiring."</p>

<p>Bert wasn't quite sure how she liked the
latter part of this remark.</p>

<p>"Before setting you any lessons, I must
find out how much you know."</p>

<p>"I guess it won't take me long to tell you
all I ever learned."</p>

<p>"Here is a reading-book. Let me hear you
read."</p>

<p>Bert took the book, and stumbled through
a paragraph, invariably mispronouncing all
words of over one syllable.</p>

<p>"There," said she, taking a long breath;
"I'm glad that is over."</p>

<p>"Now," said Mrs. Codman, taking the book,
"let me read it aloud."</p>

<p>She was an excellent reader, and Bert,
though she could not read herself, recognized
the fact.</p>

<p>"I wish I could read as well as that," said
Bert. "How awfully you must have studied
when you were a girl."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span></p>

<p>"Not so hard as you think for, perhaps,"
said her teacher, smiling. "Success depends
more upon a series of small efforts, than any
great one."</p>

<p>"Do you think I shall ever read well?"
asked Bert doubtfully.</p>

<p>"I am sure you will, if you will give a moderate
amount of attention. Do you know
anything of arithmetic?"</p>

<p>"Do you mean the Multiplication Table?"</p>

<p>"Yes, that is a part of it."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Bert, "I know some lines about
it. Charlie Morrill taught me them one day."</p>

<p>"What are they?"</p>

<p>Bert repeated these lines, which no doubt
are familiar to many of my readers:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Multiplication is vexation,</div>
<div class="verse i2">Division is as bad,</div>
<div class="verse">The rule of Three doth trouble me,</div>
<div class="verse i2">And Practice makes me mad.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Mrs. Codman smiled. "Perhaps you will like
them better as you grow better acquainted.
Can you tell me how much are four times
four?"</p>

<p>Bert went through a variety of motions in
counting her fingers, and finally announced as
the result of her computation, that four times
four made twenty-nine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span></p>

<p>"That is hardly right."</p>

<p>"I'm awful ignorant, ain't I?" asked Bert.</p>

<p>"Considerably so, I confess. But we shall
be able to remedy that."</p>

<p>"You won't make me study my eyes out?"</p>

<p>"That would be a pity. You see mine are
not yet gone, and I don't mean to ask you to
study any harder than I did."</p>

<p>Bert looked at the eyes of her teacher
which were quite as bright as her own, and
lost her apprehensions on that score.</p>

<p>"I'll tell you why I asked," said she, after
a pause. "There's a girl that goes to school&mdash;she's
only twelve years old&mdash;and she has
to wear spectacles, and I heard somebody say
it was because she studied so hard. I shouldn't
want to be obliged to wear spectacles."</p>

<p>Mrs. Codman could not forbear laughing at
the idea of her frolicsome little scholar, with
a pair of glasses perched upon her nose, and
promised her that if she found there was any
prospect of her being obliged to wear them,
she would advise her at once giving up study.</p>

<p>"Then I hope," thought Bert, "I shall need
them soon."</p>

<p>"Now," proceeded Mrs. Codman. "I am
going to give you short and easy lessons in
reading, spelling, and arithmetic. It won't
take you long to get there, if you only try.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
When you have recited them, we are to go
out and ride in the carriage."</p>

<p>"Oh, that will be nice," exclaimed the child.
"Tell me what the lesson is, quick."</p>

<p>The lessons were got and said sooner than
could have been expected, and so Bert had
taken the first step in ascending the hill of
learning.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>XXXIII.<br /> <small>A LETTER FROM CHARLIE.</small></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Bert</span> had plenty of capacity. She could
get her lessons in an incredibly short time
when there was any inducement. At other
times she would sit for two or three hours
with the book before her, but with her attention
straying to other things, and, as a natural
consequence, would know no more at the
end of that time than at the beginning. Fortunately
Mrs. Codman had the gift of patience,
and though she was gentle, was, at the same
time, firm.</p>

<p>Of one thing Bert became convinced,&mdash;that
study was not so terrible as she had imagined.
At the end of three months she had made so
great an improvement, that her father was
equally surprised and delighted, and was disposed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
to do full justice to Mrs. Codman's
merits as a governess. "Who knows but you
will become quite a learned lady in time,
Bert?" he said, playfully.</p>

<p>"No doubt of it, papa," replied Bert. "By
the time I am eighteen, I expect to wear green
glasses and write books."</p>

<p>"That will, indeed, be a miraculous transformation.
And what is to become of Topsy,
then?"</p>

<p>"Oh, she'll be an old cat then, and won't
feel any more like racing round than I do.
She'll just curl up in a chair beside me, and
I will use her fur to wipe my pens on. She
is just the right color for that, you know."</p>

<p>"Quite a sensible plan. I confess. Indeed,
it will be well for you to have something of
that kind to be employed about, as you will
probably have no beaux."</p>

<p>"No beaux, papa? And why am I to have
no beaux, I should like to know?"</p>

<p>"Because it takes two to make a bargain."</p>

<p>"Well, perhaps I sha'n't," replied Bert, tossing
her head. "Perhaps you don't know
that I have picked out my future husband."</p>

<p>"Whew! That is getting along faster than
I had anticipated. May I be permitted to
know who is to be my son-in-law? I think I
can guess, however."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span></p>

<p>"Who?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Bradley."</p>

<p>Mr. Bradley was an old bachelor, of about
fifty, partially bald and more than partially
homely, who had now and then dined with
Mr. Bowman and had taken more notice of
the young lady than she at all desired.</p>

<p>"Mr. Bradley!" repeated Bert, in a contemptuous
manner. "I'd a good deal rather
marry Topsy."</p>

<p>"Perhaps," suggested her father, "the superior
length of the kitten's whiskers causes
you to give her the preference. Am I to understand
that she is your choice?"</p>

<p>"No, it is a very handsome boy, and his
name is Charlie Codman."</p>

<p>A look of regret stole over Mrs. Codman's
face&mdash;the expression of a sorrow caused by
her uncertainty with regard to Charlie's fate.</p>

<p>"A son of yours?" asked Mr. Bowman, in
some surprise.</p>

<p>Mrs. Codman replied in the affirmative.</p>

<p>"You ought to see his miniature, papa. He
is very handsome."</p>

<p>"And you have lost your heart to him.
Perhaps he may not return the compliment."</p>

<p>"I hope he will," said the young lady.</p>

<p>"Perhaps Mrs. Codman will allow me to
look at the miniature of my future son-in-law,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
said Mr. Bowman, not guessing the mother's
sorrow and its cause.</p>

<p>While Mrs. Codman was absent from the
room, Bert gave her father a brief account of
Charlie's disappearance.</p>

<p>"You must pardon me, Mrs. Codman," said
Mr. Bowman, in a tone of feeling, when she
had returned, "for speaking in the lively tone
I did. I little guessed the anxiety you must
feel about your son. Is this the miniature?"</p>

<p>"A very attractive face!" he said. "I
don't wonder at Bert's taking a fancy to it."</p>

<p>"I cannot wonder at your sorrow in losing,
even for a time, such a boy as this face seems
to indicate," he added.</p>

<p>"You think there is a chance of his coming
back to me?" asked Mrs. Codman, anxiously.</p>

<p>"I am hardly prepared to express an opinion
on the scanty information which Bert has
been able to give me. If you are willing to
tell me the story in detail, I will tell you
what I think of the chances."</p>

<p>Mrs. Codman told the story, mentioning,
also, the name of Peter Manson, and the language
which he had used.</p>

<p>"I sometimes see this man," said the merchant,
"and know him by reputation. He is
a miser."</p>

<p>"He pretends to be very poor."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span></p>

<p>"All pretence. I do not see what object
he could have had in spiriting your son
away."</p>

<p>Further conversation followed, but, as might
be expected, no satisfactory result was reached.
Mrs. Codman, however, felt relieved and more
hopeful in the knowledge that her employer
knew of her loss, and would do what he could
to discover Charlie.</p>

<p>It was only a week later that he came into
the school-room with a smile upon his face.</p>

<p>"Father, you bring good news; isn't it so?"
said Bert.</p>

<p>"I hope so."</p>

<p>Mrs. Codman looked up with a glance of
eager inquiry.</p>

<p>"As I took up the morning paper," said the
merchant, "my eyes, by chance, ran down the
list of advertised letters. Recognizing the
name of Mrs. Codman among them, I took the
liberty of sending to the office for it. It is
post-marked at Rio Janeiro."</p>

<p>"Oh, give it to me quick!" exclaimed Mrs.
Codman, in agitation.</p>

<p>"Is it from Charlie?" asked Bert.</p>

<p>"It is, it is!" exclaimed the happy mother,
as she recognized the familiar handwriting;
and too impatient to unseal the letter, she
tore it open and devoured the contents.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span></p>

<p>It was the letter which Charlie had commenced
on shipboard. We will give the
greater part of it.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
"<span class="smcap">Dearest Mother</span>,&mdash;<br />
</p>

<p>"I hope this letter will reach you in safety,
and will relieve you of some of the anxiety
you must have felt about your wandering boy.
You will start with surprise when you see
where this is dated. I am three thousand
miles from you, dear mother, but not by my
own act. But I must tell you how I came to
leave you. (This portion of the letter is
omitted.) You mustn't think I have suffered
all the time on board the ship, though it is
hard work, and, for some reason, the captain
and mate have both been my enemies. I have
had one faithful friend, to whom I am very
much indebted. He is a rough sailor, and
neither educated nor refined, but he has a
warm heart, and has been very kind to your
boy. Indeed, mother, I don't know how much
trouble I should have had, if it hadn't been
for honest Bill Sturdy. Some time I hope
you will have the pleasure of taking him by
the hand, and thanking him for all he has
done for me. The greatest act of friendship
for which I have to thank him I will not
write here, but I will tell you some time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span></p>

<p>"As we were neither of us treated as well
as we ought to be, we have deserted the vessel,
and transferred ourselves to a ship bound
to Liverpool, and thence to New York; so
that it may be some months from now before
I see you again.</p>

<p>"I am so afraid you have suffered since I
left you, not only from solitude and anxiety
about me, but have been compelled to labor
beyond your strength. You were so poorly
paid for that horrid sewing, and had to work
so hard at it. But when I come back we
will live together, as we once did; and though
it will not be a luxurious home, it shall be a
happy one. As you may have moved elsewhere,
you must leave word with those who
occupy our old room where you live, so that
when I come back, which will be just as soon
as I can, I may come at once to you, and tell
you how much I have missed you.</p>

<p class="right">
<span style="margin-right: 3em;">"From your affectionate,</span><br />
"<span class="smcap">Charlie</span>."
</p>
</div>

<p>Knowing that Mr. Bowman felt a friendly
interest in Charlie's welfare, Mrs. Codman, her
eyes dim with happy tears, handed him the
letter, which he read attentively.</p>

<p>"A very good letter," he said, "and very
creditable to the writer. When he returns,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
if you and he are both willing, I will receive
him at once into my counting-room. His
letter is sufficient recommendation."</p>

<p>How differently the world looks according
to the mood in which we view it. No one
could have convinced Mrs. Codman, after the
reception of this letter, that it was not a perfect
paradise. The patient sorrow which her
face had worn the day before, gave place to
a sweet and happy expression, which made
her look quite charming.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Codman is really a beautiful woman,"
thought Mr. Bowman, as unobserved, he
watched her laughing with Bert, glancing
over the newspaper which he was supposed
to be reading.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>XXXIV.<br /> <small>THE RETURN OF THE BETSEY.</small></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was a fine morning when the Bouncing
Betsey, after a quick and prosperous voyage
from Valparaiso, entered Boston harbor.
There had been few or no changes on board
since the ship left Rio Janeiro on the passage
out. Captain Brace is still in command, and
unfortunately has not at all mended his ways,
but has richly merited, as he has obtained,
the general dislike of the crew, not one of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
whom will sail with him again unless forced
by dire necessity. Second in odium as he is
in command, comes Randall the mate. He
cares little how he is regarded by the men
under him. To him the voyage has proved
in some respects a disappointment. He has
not recovered from the vexation occasioned
by the escape of Bill Sturdy and Charlie. He
has anticipated with eagerness the return to
Boston, where he hopes first to meet with the
deserters, and secondly intends to wrest a
further sum from the fears of Peter Manson.</p>

<p>Before visiting the miser, however, it is his
intention to find out what he can about Mrs.
Codman, and how she has fared. He hopes
in his vindictiveness she has been reduced to
the deepest distress, and the hardest shifts to
procure a livelihood.</p>

<p>He made his way to the tenement-house
where Mrs. Codman formerly lodged. He
went up to the door of her former room and
knocked, but it was opened by a stranger, who
could give him no information about the person
for whom he inquired.</p>

<p>Perplexed and quite at a loss to obtain a
clew to the knowledge he desired, he went
back to Washington Street, and mingled in
the busy throng that crowded the sidewalks.
He walked leisurely along, gazing listlessly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
into the shop windows, but intent upon his
own thoughts.</p>

<p>Chancing to let his eyes rest upon a passing
carriage, he was startled by the glimpse of a
face which he was sure he knew. It was an
elegant carriage, drawn by two spirited horses,
and evidently the equipage of a person of
wealth. A negro coachman in livery sat upon
the box, and wielded the reins with a dexterous
hand. There were two persons inside&mdash;one
was a child of ten, a lively young girl,
across whose face a hundred changeful expressions
flit. She was talking in an animated
strain to a lady with a beautiful and
expressive face, who sat beside her.</p>

<p>These two persons were Bert and her governess.
The latter was looking better than
when she was introduced to the reader. Surrounded
by comforts and luxuries, and above
all relieved from her most pressing anxiety
by the letter which she had received from
Charlie, her cheeks had recovered their wonted
fullness and bloom, and the rare beauty for
which she had been distinguished in her
youth.</p>

<p>Randall could scarcely believe his eyes.
This was the woman whom he had pictured
to himself as struggling amid the deepest
poverty to obtain a scanty subsistence, worn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
out by harrowing anxiety for the loss of her
only son. What a contrast to his anticipations
was the reality! He saw her tastefully
dressed&mdash;the picture of health and happiness&mdash;with
the same beauty that had dazzled him
in times past, surrounded by evidence of prosperity
and luxury.</p>

<p>"What can it mean?" he thought in bewilderment.
"Is it possible that my eyes are
deceived by an accidental resemblance?"</p>

<p>The carriage had already passed him, but
as it was obliged to proceed slowly on account
of a press of carriages, he had no difficulty,
by quickening his pace a little, in overtaking
it, and again scanning the face whose presence
there had filled him with so much surprise.</p>

<p>The first explanation which suggested itself
to him as possible was, that Mrs. Codman had
attracted the attention of some wealthy gentleman,
who forgetting the distance which
circumstances had established between them,
had laid himself and his fortune at her feet.
But even then how could she appear so lighthearted
and happy unless Charlie had returned?
There was another supposition that
old Peter Manson had died, and on his deathbed,
repenting his past wickedness and injustice,
had repaired the wrong of which he had
been guilty, as far as he could, by leaving all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
his possessions to Mrs. Codman. This was
to Randall the most disagreeable supposition
of the two, for it would effectually stand in
the way of the designs which he cherished
against the same property.</p>

<p>Determined not to lose sight of Mrs. Codman,
he with considerable difficulty kept pace
with the carriage. It chanced that Bert and
her governess were just returning from a
drive, otherwise they might have led Randall
a long chase. At present they were not very
far from home.</p>

<p>From the opposite side of the street Randall
watched them descend the steps of the
carriage, and enter the house. He paused
long enough afterwards to cross the street,
note down the name of Bowman together
with the number, that he might be able to
identify it hereafter. He then examined the
house itself with some curiosity. The appearance
of the house indicated clearly enough
the wealth of the owner.</p>

<p>"I wish I knew," muttered the mate, "on
what footing Mrs. Codman resides here. She
must either be the wife of the proprietor or
his housekeeper, one or the other."</p>

<p>At this moment an infirm old woman limped
out of the side-gate, with a basket slung on
her arm.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span></p>

<p>Pressing forward, he accosted her.</p>

<p>"You seem heavily laden, my good
woman."</p>

<p>"Yes," said she, "thanks to the good lady
who lives in the house."</p>

<p>"What is her name?"</p>

<p>"It's Mrs. Codman. Do you know her,
sir?"</p>

<p>"I am not sure. I once knew some one of
the name. But there is a different name on
the door&mdash;Bowman."</p>

<p>"Yes, he is the gentleman of the house."</p>

<p>"And Mrs. Codman?"</p>

<p>"She is the young lady's governess."</p>

<p>"How long has she been there?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, sir."</p>

<p>"Never mind. It doesn't matter much."</p>

<p>"I wish I could tell you, sir."</p>

<p>"It's of no consequence at all, and you
needn't mention that any questions have been
asked you. But I am afraid I have been
detaining you. Here is something to pay
you for your trouble."</p>

<p>So saying he slipped half a dollar into her
hand and, avoiding her profuse thanks, walked
hastily away.</p>

<p>"Now, for a visit to the miser," he said to
himself.</p>

<h2>XXXV.<br /> <small>CHARLIE TURNS UP UNEXPECTEDLY.</small></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">There</span> was but little variety in the monotonous
life of Peter Manson. His life was
one struggle for gold, his thoughts were continually
upon gold; gold seemed to be the
end and aim of his existence. But what
did he propose to do with it all? He was not
an old man yet, but all the infirmities of age
were upon him.</p>

<p>Peter had not forgotten nor ceased to
lament the heavy draft which had been made
upon him by Randall. The thousands which
he had left could not compensate to him for
the one he had lost. So, in the hope of
making it up, he strove to live even more
economically than before, if, indeed, that
were possible. The additional privations to
which he subjected himself began to tell
upon the old man's constitution. He grew
thinner and weaker and more shrivelled than
before, and all this to save a penny or two
additional each day.</p>

<p>As Peter was crawling feebly along towards
his gloomy den one afternoon, clad in
the invariable blue cloak, he was startled by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
hearing a hoarse voice behind him, calling
out, "Peter Manson&mdash;Peter, I say!"</p>

<p>"Who calls?" asked Peter, in a quavering
voice, slowly turning round.</p>

<p>"Don't you remember me?" asked Randall,
for it was he.</p>

<p>Peter muttered something unintelligible as
he cast a terrified glance at the mate, and
quickened his pace.</p>

<p>"You're not very polite, Peter," said the
other, quickly overtaking and joining the old
man. "Is this the way to greet an old friend,
whom you have not seen for nearly a year?"</p>

<p>Peter looked anxious and alarmed, and
glanced askance at his companion.</p>

<p>By this time they had reached the miser's
quarters, and Peter, taking out a key, opened
the door.</p>

<p>He opened it just sufficiently to admit himself,
and was then about to close it when
Randall, unceremoniously pushing him aside,
entered also.</p>

<p>"By your leave, Peter, I will spend a short
time with you."</p>

<p>"I have no fire," said Peter Manson, hastily.</p>

<p>"I dare say not," said Randall, carelessly,
"but you can easily kindle one."</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I have no fuel."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span></p>

<p>"None at all?"</p>

<p>"Why, a little&mdash;a very little," stammered
Peter, uneasily.</p>

<p>"I thought so. Come, lead the way. I
won't trouble you to light the fire. I'll do it
myself."</p>

<p>With something that sounded like a groan,
the old man led the way, and ushered his
unwelcome guest into the room described in
one of the earlier chapters.</p>

<p>Randall used as much wood in kindling a
fire as would have lasted Peter a whole day.</p>

<p>"You will ruin me," he said, in dismay.</p>

<p>"Then you'll be ruined in a good cause,"
said Randall. "But I say, Peter, don't you
remember what we talked about when I
visited you last?"</p>

<p>The old man groaned, thinking of the thousand
dollars.</p>

<p>"Seems to me it has not left a very agreeable
impression upon your mind," remarked
his companion. "Don't you want me to tell
you of the boy that I spirited away?"</p>

<p>"Is he dead?" asked Peter, eagerly.</p>

<p>"No; curse him, he escaped from me."</p>

<p>"You&mdash;you didn't let him know about the
money?"</p>

<p>"Which you feloniously kept from him?
Was that what you mean?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ye&mdash;yes."</p>

<p>"No, I didn't."</p>

<p>Peter looked relieved.</p>

<p>"Where is he now?"</p>

<p>"Heaven knows! I don't. He deserted
from the ship at Rio Janeiro. But let me ask
you, in turn, Peter, what has become of the
mother, whom each of us has so much reason
to hate?"</p>

<p>"I don't know."</p>

<p>"Then she is no longer a tenant of yours?"</p>

<p>"She moved in less than a month after you
went away."</p>

<p>"Couldn't pay her rent, ha!"</p>

<p>"Yes; she paid it as long as she stayed. I
have not seen or heard anything of her
since."</p>

<p>"I have," said the mate, significantly.</p>

<p>"You!" exclaimed Peter, eagerly.</p>

<p>"I saw her to-day."</p>

<p>"How&mdash;where?"</p>

<p>"In a carriage."</p>

<p>"A carriage!" echoed Peter, in surprise.</p>

<p>"Yes; looking as bright and handsome as
when she rejected you with scorn."</p>

<p>The miser frowned.</p>

<p>"Where did you meet her?"</p>

<p>"On Washington Street. I was walking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
there when I chanced to look into a gay carriage
that was driving by, and saw her."</p>

<p>"Are you sure you are not mistaken?"</p>

<p>"No. I followed her to her place of residence."</p>

<p>"Where is it?"</p>

<p>"No.&mdash;&mdash;Mt. Vernon Street."</p>

<p>"She must be rich, then."</p>

<p>"No; she is a governess there, though
enjoying, I should think, unusual privileges,
and is, no doubt, happy."</p>

<p>Peter made no reply, but seemed occupied
by other thoughts.</p>

<p>"And now, Peter, have you any idea what
I came for?"</p>

<p>"To tell me this."</p>

<p>"I am not fool enough to take all this
trouble."</p>

<p>"Then I don't know."</p>

<p>"I want money, Peter."</p>

<p>Peter could not be said to change color, but
he grew more ghastly than before, at this
demand.</p>

<p>"I have nothing to give you," he said.</p>

<p>"Tell that to the marines. You must give
me another thousand dollars."</p>

<p>"Another thousand dollars!" exclaimed the
old man. "Where do you think I should get
it? Did I not impoverish myself in satisfying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
your last demand, and have I not been obliged
to live on bread and water since?"</p>

<p>Randall shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"I dare say you have lived on bread and
water, but as to being obliged to, that is nonsense.
I ask you again, to give me a thousand
dollars. You will have thousands
left."</p>

<p>"I shall be a beggar," said the old man,
passionately.</p>

<p>"A beggar!" returned Randall, laughing
scornfully.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Peter, with energy. "You
promised, when I gave you a thousand dollars,"&mdash;his
voice faltered as he recalled the
sacrifice,&mdash;"that you would ask no more.
Now, you come back for another sum as large,
and it is not yet a year. You shall not have
it!" he exclaimed, passionately; "not if I
had it fifty times over."</p>

<p>"Bethink you what you are saying, old
man," said Randall, menacingly. "Do you
know that I can go to Mrs. Codman and denounce
you?"</p>

<p>"You will not," said Peter, trembling.</p>

<p>"But I will, unless you comply with my
demand. Now what do you say? Better be
reasonable, and consent, before I compel
you."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span></p>

<p>"Never!" exclaimed the miser, desperately.</p>

<p>"I will denounce you to the police. Shall
I have the money?"</p>

<p>But Peter was no longer to be moved, even
by his fears. His love of money overcame
every other consideration, and again he exclaimed,
"Never!" with all the energy of
which he was capable.</p>

<p>"Is this your final answer?"</p>

<p>"It is."</p>

<p>"Then I will help myself," said Randall,
coolly, leaving his chair, and beginning to lift
up the trap-door, beneath which was the
miser's box of treasure.</p>

<p>As soon as Peter fairly comprehended his
design, and saw the gold coins in the grasp of
the purloiner, unable to restrain himself, he
threw himself upon the mate with a cry as of
a lioness deprived of her young, and grasped
the strong man by the throat with fingers,
which, though naturally weak, despair and
rage made strong. At all events, it was not
particularly comfortable, and provoked Randall,
who seized the old man in his strong
arms, and, with a muttered curse, hurled
him to the floor, where he lay pale and
senseless.</p>

<p>"Confusion!" muttered Randall, in dismay,
for Peter had uttered a shrill scream as he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
fell. "I am afraid I shall get into an ugly
scrape."</p>

<p>He was not altogether wrong.</p>

<p>The scream had been heard by two, at least,
who were passing. The door was burst open,
and in rushed Bill Sturdy and Charlie, our
young hero, who had just returned to Boston,
and were passing on their way up from the
wharf at which the vessel was lying.</p>

<p>"Mr. Randall!" exclaimed Charlie, in surprised
recognition.</p>

<p>Randall strove to escape through the opened
door, but Sturdy, seizing him in his powerful
grasp, cried, "Not so fast, my hearty! You've
been up to some mischief, and if I don't see
justice done you, may I never see salt water
again!"</p>

<h2>XXXVI.<br /> <small>HOW CHARLIE COMES INTO HIS FORTUNE.</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Probably</span> there were no two persons then
living whom Randall at that moment cared
less about seeing than Bill Sturdy and our
hero. Though astonished beyond expression
to see them there, his position was too critical
to allow him to waste time in giving expression
to his surprise.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span></p>

<p>"Let me go, you scoundrel!" he exclaimed,
making a desperate effort to elude Bill's
grasp.</p>

<p>He might as well have striven to tear himself
from the grasp of a lion.</p>

<p>"Not so fast, Mr. Randall," said Bill
Sturdy.</p>

<p>"You mutinous scoundrel!" hissed the
mate.</p>

<p>"You forget," said his captor, coolly, "that
we are not now on the quarter-deck. Here I
am your equal, Mr. Randall, and perhaps you
may find me a little ahead."</p>

<p>"Let me go, if you know what is best for
yourself," ejaculated Randall, almost foaming
at the mouth.</p>

<p>"If you know what is best for yourself,"
said Bill composedly, "I would advise you
to be quiet."</p>

<p>"And now," he continued, tightening his
grasp a little, "just let me know what mischief
you have been up to?"</p>

<p>"I am not responsible to you," said Randall
haughtily.</p>

<p>"Responsible or not, you must give an
account of yourself."</p>

<p>"If you will let me go, I will make it worth
your while."</p>

<p>"Do you think I am mean enough to accept<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
a bribe?" exclaimed Sturdy, with honest
indignation. "Let me know what you have
been doing."</p>

<p>"This old man!" said Randall, curbing his
pride, "foolishly thought I meant to rob him,
and shrieked for assistance."</p>

<p>"Is that all?" asked Bill, keenly glancing
at the box of gold. "Things look as if you
were going to rob him in reality."</p>

<p>"I am not in the habit of thieving," said
Randall, haughtily.</p>

<p>At this moment the miser, who had been
insensible, began to show signs of returning
consciousness.</p>

<p>"Go and get some water, Charlie," said
Bill. "The old man looks as if he might
come to with a little help."</p>

<p>There was a pail half full of water standing
near by. Charlie sprinkled Peter's face,
and a moment after he gasped and opened
his eyes. He cast a frightened glance from
face to face till his eyes rested on Randall,
when he shuddered, and cried feebly, "Take
him away, take him away! He will rob
me."</p>

<p>"Not while I am here to prevent him,"
returned Bill, in a tone of assurance.</p>

<p>"You are friends, then?" said the miser,
anxiously.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span></p>

<p>"Of course we are. Did this man attempt
to rob you?"</p>

<p>"Take care not to make any false accusations,
old man," said Randall, menacingly.</p>

<p>"Speak the truth without fear," said Bill
Sturdy; "I'll bear you out in it. He can't
do you any harm."</p>

<p>"He demanded a thousand dollars from
me," said the old man, "and when I would
not give it to him he was going to help
himself."</p>

<p>"What do you say to that, Mr. Randall?"
asked Sturdy.</p>

<p>"I say this," said the mate, turning a malignant
glance upon the miser, "that it was a
regular bargain&mdash;a matter of business. This
man owed me the money&mdash;he knows best
what for, and refused to pay it."</p>

<p>"I did not," said Peter, hastily, "he had
already been paid in full."</p>

<p>"Take care, Peter, or I may tell what it
was for."</p>

<p>"I defy you," said the miser in a quavering
tone of defiance. "You are a bad man."</p>

<p>"Perhaps you don't know who this boy
is?" said Randall.</p>

<p>"Who is he?" asked Peter, doubtfully.</p>

<p>"He is one who has reason to consider you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
his enemy," said Randall, "even more than
myself."</p>

<p>At this unexpected statement Bill Sturdy
and Charlie looked at each other in surprise.</p>

<p>"Do you know this old man, then,
Charlie?" asked Sturdy, at length.</p>

<p>"Yes," said our hero; "it is Mr. Manson,
of whom my mother used to hire a room."</p>

<p>"The landlord?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"And what harm has he ever done to
you?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," said Charlie, shaking his
head, "unless," and an anxious look came
over his face, "he has distressed her for rent
since I have been gone."</p>

<p>"Is that so?" demanded the sailor, sternly.</p>

<p>"No, no!" said Peter Manson, hastily.
"She left my tenement a good many months
ago."</p>

<p>"And where is she now?" asked Charlie,
eagerly&mdash;for, having just landed, he knew
nothing of his mother's whereabouts.</p>

<p>"Then you have not seen her?" asked
Randall, with the sudden thought that he
might make better terms for himself by selling
his knowledge on the subject.</p>

<p>"No," said Charlie. "Is she well? Tell
me, I entreat you, if you know."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span></p>

<p>"I do know," said Randall, composedly,
"both where she is and how she has fared."</p>

<p>"Tell me quick."</p>

<p>"That depend upon circumstances. While
I am held in custody I have little inducement
to do you a favor."</p>

<p>"Sturdy will release you, won't you,
Sturdy. Only tell me where my mother is,
that I may go to her at once."</p>

<p>"Why," said Bill, cautiously, "I don't know,
exactly. He may be trying a game, and giving
us information won't be worth anything."</p>

<p>"You can keep me here till you have sent
to ascertain if I have told you the truth."</p>

<p>"No, no," said Peter Manson, terrified at the
prospect, "don't let him stay here. He would
rob me."</p>

<p>"Rob you," sneered Randall; "it looks well
in you whose money has been dishonestly
gained, to charge me with theft."</p>

<p>"He&mdash;you won't mind what he says, gentlemen,"
said Peter Manson, trembling. "He
only says it to spite me."</p>

<p>"To spite you! Yes, you old hunks, I will
spite you, and that with a vengeance! Hark
you, Sturdy, I have kept this old man's secret
long enough, and though I hate you, and that
boy there, I believe I hate him worse. If I
will reveal to this boy a secret which will insure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
to him a property of from twenty to
thirty thousand dollars, will you agree to let
me go, and give me a thousand dollars?"</p>

<p>"Can you do it?" demanded Sturdy, in
surprise.</p>

<p>"I can."</p>

<p>"Well, it ain't for me to say, but if I
were Charlie here I would close with your
terms."</p>

<p>"Don't you believe him," said Peter, terrified.
"He is only making a fool of you. He
can't do what he says."</p>

<p>Charlie was not a little astonished at the
turn affairs had taken.</p>

<p>"I shouldn't wonder," said Bill, "if there
might be something in this, as long as the old
man seems so afraid the secret will be let
out."</p>

<p>"You will find that I have told you the
truth," said Randall; "tell me quickly yes or
no. If you decline, you will lose more than
I shall."</p>

<p>"Then," said Charlie, "I will accept your
terms so far as I am concerned."</p>

<p>"And I'll bear witness to it," said Bill, "if
you will carry out your part of the agreement."</p>

<p>"That I will do to your satisfaction. The
first thing to be explained is, that in carrying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
this boy to sea I was only acting as the agent
of another."</p>

<p>"And that other!"</p>

<p>"Was Peter Manson&mdash;the man you see before
you."</p>

<p>"It is false," said the miser, turning ghastly
pale.</p>

<p>"Moreover," said Randall, "I was well paid
for the service. I received a thousand dollars."</p>

<p>"Oh, oh!" cried the old man, swaying
backward and forward&mdash;"a thousand dollars
in bright gold, and I so poor."</p>

<p>"You see he admits it," said Randall.</p>

<p>"And what did he want Charlie carried
away for?"</p>

<p>"Reason enough for that. He feared the
boy might learn that it was his wealth which
he has been hoarding up."</p>

<p>"Mine!" exclaimed Charlie, in unbounded
surprise.</p>

<p>"Did you never hear your mother speak of
a certain Peter Thornton, who by purloining
and making off with twenty thousand dollars
caused your grandfather to fail?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, often."</p>

<p>"<i>That man is Peter Thornton!</i>" said Randall,
pointing with his finger to the miser.</p>

<p>The latter half rose from his seat, and then,
as if he had received a mortal wound sank to
the floor.</p>

<p>"You require no other confirmation of my
words," said the mate.</p>

<p>"Why my lad, you will be a rich man,"
said Bill Sturdy, his face beaming with satisfaction.</p>

<p>"How glad mother will be!" exclaimed
Charlie. "Where is she, Mr. Randall? I
want so much to see her."</p>

<p>The mate gave Charlie briefly the information
he required, and added, "You will probably
need my assistance to establish your
claim to the property of which yonder old
man has so long deprived you. I shall hold
myself at your service, trusting to your honor
to pay me the thousand dollars agreed
upon."</p>

<p>"You shall not trust in vain, Mr. Randall,"
said Charlie, promptly. "Place me in possession<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
of what is rightfully mine, and you
shall have no reason to complain."</p>

<p>"Very well, I shall stop at the Tremont
House for the present. There you or your
lawyer will find me. I advise you to employ
legal assistance."</p>

<p>"I will do so, and thank you for the suggestion.
As soon as I have seen my mother
I shall proceed to business."</p>

<p>Randall withdrew, but was quickly followed
by Charlie and his friend.</p>

<p>"Where are you going, my lad?" asked the
sailor.</p>

<p>"You needn't ask, Bill,&mdash;to see my best
friend, my mother. It is for her sake that I
welcome this fortune. She shall never want
any more while I have money. We will
have a nice little home, where you shall be
welcome, Bill, always and all the time."</p>

<p>Bill pressed the hand of our young hero in
his own rough palm, and there was a suspicious
moisture about his eyes, but he said
nothing.</p>

<h2>XXXVII.<br /> <small>REUNITED AT LAST.</small></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Codman</span> was sitting in a little room
opening out from the breakfast-room, which
had been appropriated as a sort of study by
Bert and herself.</p>

<p>Topsy, the kitten, who had not yet attained
the sobriety and demureness of old cat-hood,
was running round after her tail.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear," sighed Bert, who was puzzling
over a lesson in geography, "I can't study
any to-day."</p>

<p>"Why not?" asked Mrs. Codman.</p>

<p>"Oh, I feel so restless."</p>

<p>"That isn't very unusual, is it?" asked her
governess, with a smile.</p>

<p>"I feel more so than usual. Something is
going to happen, I know."</p>

<p>"Something does happen every day, doesn't
there?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, you know what I mean; something
out of the way. I shouldn't wonder if Charlie
got home to-day."</p>

<p>"Heaven grant he may!" exclaimed his
mother, fervently.</p>

<p>By a strange coincidence&mdash;and coincidences
do sometimes happen in real life, though not
quite so often, perhaps, as in stories,&mdash;Mrs.
Codman had hardly given utterance to her
wish when the bell rang.</p>

<p>Bert jumped from her seat.</p>

<p>"It is he, I know it is!" she exclaimed.
"Do let me go to the door."</p>

<p>"You are very fanciful to-day, Bert," said
Mrs. Codman. But she did not forbid her
going. Bert's earnestness had given birth
to a wild hope on her part, that it might be
as she had fancied.</p>

<p>Before the loitering servant had a chance
to reach the door, Bert had already opened
it.</p>

<p>Bill Sturdy and Charlie stood on the steps,
Charlie looking handsome and manly, with
an eager look on his bright face. Sturdy, it
must be owned, looked and felt a little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
awkward, not being accustomed to call as a
visitor at houses as elegant as Mr. Bowman's.</p>

<p>"Oh! this is Charlie, isn't it?" exclaimed
Bert, with childish delight, instinctively putting
out her hand.</p>

<p>"What, do you know me?" asked Charlie,
pleased with this cordial reception, but astonished
at being recognized.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes."</p>

<p>"Is my mother here?"</p>

<p>"Yes; I will go and call her. But won't
you come in?"</p>

<p>"I would rather you would call her," said
Charlie, bashfully.</p>

<p>Bert danced back into the little study.</p>

<p>"I was right, Mrs. Codman," said she,
triumphantly, "It is Charlie."</p>

<p>"Has he come?" asked the mother, precipitately,
letting fall, as she rose, the astonished
kitten, who had clambered into her lap.
"Oh, where is he?"</p>

<p>"At the door."</p>

<p>Mrs. Codman waited for no more, but hastened
to the door, and, in a moment, the
mother was face to face with her lost boy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
Of the delight of that meeting, of the numberless
questions which each had to ask, with
what fond pride the mother noted the increased
manliness of Charlie, I cannot speak
in detail. Both hearts were full to overflowing
with love and gratitude.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Bert was endeavoring, in her
way, to entertain Bill Sturdy, who, though no
man was braver or more self-reliant among
his comrades, felt abashed in the presence of
Bert, whom he looked upon as made of finer
clay than himself. And, indeed, the beauty
and sprightliness of the child made her look
like a charming picture, and even Charlie's
eyes could not help straying to her, from time
to time, while he was talking with his
mother.</p>

<p>Bill was perched upon an elegant chair,
scarcely daring to rest his whole weight upon
it, for fear it might give way under him,
swinging his hat awkwardly in his hand.</p>

<p>"You are Bill Sturdy, are you not?"
said Bert, determined to become better
acquainted.</p>

<p>"How do you know that is my name?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
asked Bill, half fancying she must have learned
it in some supernatural way.</p>

<p>"Oh, Charlie wrote about you in his letter."</p>

<p>"Did his mother get a letter from him,
then?"</p>

<p>"Yes; it was from some place with a hard
name. I never can remember those geography
names."</p>

<p>"Was it Rio Janeiro?"</p>

<p>"Yes; that was it. What an awful time
he must have had! Do you like going to
sea?"</p>

<p>"Yes, miss; I feel more at home on the sea
than on the land."</p>

<p>"You do! Well, that's funny. I know
I should be sea-sick, and that must be
horrid."</p>

<p>"Well, it doesn't feel very pleasant," said
Bill, with a smile.</p>

<p>"Oh, Mr. Sturdy, did you ever see a
whale?"</p>

<p>"Yes, miss, plenty of them."</p>

<p>"I suppose you never came near being
swallowed by one&mdash;like Jonah, you know?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span></p>

<p>"No, miss; I don't think I should like
that."</p>

<p>"What lots of adventures you must have
had! You must stay to dinner, and afterwards
you can tell me of some."</p>

<p>"I don't think I could, thank you, miss, all
the same," said Bill, alarmed at the suggestion.
"Not but I'd be glad to spin you a
yarn some time."</p>

<p>Just then Charlie bethought himself of his
companion.</p>

<p>"Mother," said he, "you must let me introduce
to you my good friend, Bill Sturdy.
You don't know how kind he has been to
me."</p>

<p>"I am quite ready to believe it," said Mrs.
Codman, holding out her hand quickly.</p>

<p>Bill took it shyly in his.</p>

<p>"I thank you most heartily for all you have
done for my dear boy," said she.</p>

<p>"Anybody that wasn't a brute would have
done as much, ma'am."</p>

<p>"Then I am afraid there are a great many
brutes in the world."</p>

<p>Charlie stopped to dinner, but Bill could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
not be prevailed upon to do so. "You see,
my boy," he explained to Charlie, "it don't
come nat'ral; I shouldn't know how to behave.
So I'll just go back to my boardinghouse,
and you'll find me there after dinner."</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>XXXVIII.<br /> <small>REACHING PORT.</small></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Will</span> the reader imagine a year to have
passed?</p>

<p>During the time several things have happened.</p>

<p>In the first place, Mr. Bowman has invited
Charlie to become a member of his
family.</p>

<p>In the second place, charmed by the beauty
and grace, as well as the more valuable qualities
of Mrs. Codman, with whom he has
had a good chance of becoming acquainted
during her residence in his family, he has
invited her to become his wife. Mrs. Codman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
was taken by surprise, but found this
proposition not altogether unwelcome. She
had become attached to Bert, who added her
persuasions to those of her father, and at
length her governess promised to assume to
her a nearer relation.</p>

<p>Through the testimony of Randall, the
identity of Peter Manson with Peter Thornton
was fully established, and the law decided
that the miser's wealth must go to Charlie
and his mother. It was found to exceed the
estimate which had been made of it, verging
close upon forty thousand dollars. Including
interest for twenty years, all this, and
more of right, belonged to those who had so
long been defrauded of it.</p>

<p>Mrs. Codman could not help pitying the
miserable and disconsolate old man, pinched
with privation, which had enfeebled him, and
made him old before his time. She continued
to allow him the use of the old building
which he had occupied so many years, and
allowed him a certain sum payable on the
first of every month, to provide for his
wants.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span></p>

<p>The sudden loss of the gold which he had
been hoarding up so long did not kill Peter
Manson, but it affected his intellect. The
habit of avarice never left him. He saved
up nine tenths of his allowance, and starved
himself on the remainder. Attempts were
made to remedy this by bringing him supplies
of fuel and provisions, but these he
economized as before. One day, when Charlie
looked in to see how he was getting along,
he beheld a sight which made him start back
in affright.</p>

<p>The old man lay stretched out upon the
floor cold and dead, with a few gold pieces
firmly clutched in his grasp. He had received
a sudden summons while engaged in
counting over the little gold he had accumulated
from his allowance.</p>

<p>So ended the wasted life of Peter Manson,
the miser.</p>

<p>From him we turn to others who have
figured in these pages.</p>

<p>Randall received the thousand dollars
which had been promised as the reward of
his disclosure. It appeared as if prosperity,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
rather than retribution, was to attend him.
He succeeded in obtaining the command of a
fine ship, with an excellent salary, and sailed
with fair prospects. But his tyrannical habits
had not deserted him. His unjustifiable
abuse aroused the deadly anger of one of the
crew, a man of excitable temper, who, before
he could be withheld, plunged a knife into
his heart one day, just after punishment,
killing him instantly.</p>

<p>As for Captain Brace, he, too, demands a
word. Brief mention will suffice. In a fit
of ungovernable rage he burst a blood-vessel,
and he, too, died instantly, without a moment's
preparation, in which to repent of the
many wrongs he had committed.</p>

<p>From the sad fate of these miserable men
we turn gladly to brighter scenes.</p>

<p>Mrs. Codman, now Mrs. Bowman, has had
no cause to regret her second choice. Her
husband commands her respect and esteem,
and makes her very happy. Charlie is now
at an excellent school. After he has completed
a liberal course of instruction, he will
enter the counting-room of his step-father,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
where, as we cannot doubt, an honorable and
useful career awaits him.</p>

<p>As for Bill Sturdy,&mdash;honest, brave, stout-hearted
Bill Sturdy,&mdash;he could not be persuaded
to abandon the sea, but now sails as
captain of a vessel belonging to Mr. Bowman.
He is unboundedly popular with his crew,
whom he treats as comrades in whose welfare
he is interested. Whenever he is in port,
Captain Sturdy dines once with Mr. Bowman.
He feels more at his ease now than when he
was only a forecastle hand, but he will always
be modest and unassuming. He is a prime
favorite with Bert, and always brings her
home something when he returns from foreign
parts.</p>

<p>It is not ours to read the future; but I
should not be surprised, when Charlie
grows to manhood, if we should find Bert's
early choice of him as her husband prophetic.</p>

<p>So we bid farewell to Charlie Codman.
His trials and struggles have come early in

youth, and be graced by all the noblest

be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
